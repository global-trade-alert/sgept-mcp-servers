The plan identified 25 target sectors* across clean energy, infrastructure, and advanced industries. The announcement did not specify the intervention types or financial instruments through which support would be delivered.</p><p>The strategic plan identified three targets: accelerating decarbonisation, enabling place-based investment across all UK nations, and strengthening sovereign capabilities in critical supply chains. The NWF stated that its support is expected to create or sustain more than 200'000 jobs and help avoid 500 million tonnes of CO2e emissions by 2050.</p><p>In this context, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Clean energy is not just about energy sovereignty, it is about bringing back the good industrial jobs that have been denied to our country for too long. Thanks to the certainty of the government's clean energy superpower mission and public investment like this - the industry is responding with record investment- meaning better jobs for people across our country.\"</p><p>*Hydrogen; Battery manufacturing &amp; the electric vehicle supply chain; Steel; Power grid; Energy storage; Nuclear; Transport infrastructure; Place-based regeneration; Ports &amp; supply chains; Carbon capture, usage and storage; Artificial Intelligence; Semiconductors; Quantum technologies; Defence; Advanced materials; Life sciences; Critical minerals; Aerospace supply chain; Sustainable aviation fuels; Water; Offshore wind; Retrofit; Solar; Heat networks; Electric vehicle charging.</p>"

A price cap of CAD 50'000 (USD 36'942) applies to vehicles manufactured in countries with which Canada has free trade agreements; however, Canadian-made electric vehicles are exempt from this cap.</p><p>This differential treatment effectively extends the subsidy to a wider range of Canadian-produced vehicles \u2014 including higher-priced models \u2014 while excluding comparable foreign-made EVs from the same benefit, thereby conferring a competitive advantage on domestic producers.</p><p>In this context, Mark Carney, Prime Minister of Canada, said: \u201cCanada\u2019s new government is fundamentally transforming our economy \u2013 from one reliant on a single trade partner, to one that is stronger, more independent, and more resilient to global shocks. We are making strategic decisions and generational investments to build a strong Canadian auto sector, where Canadian workers build the cars of the future\".</p>"

Among other actions the communication signals the EU's intention to support the development of homegrown technologies through state aid.</p><p>More concretely, the Action Plan emphasises accelerating the expansion and industrial scaling of EU-based drone and counter-drone companies, as well as increasing manufacturing capacity, by:</p>\n<ul><li>identifying strategic investment priorities that favour innovative, scalable solutions developed by emerging actors operating across both civilian and defence sectors;</li><li>coordinating and activating sufficient public and private financing at both national and EU levels, spanning civilian and military domains;</li><li>drawing on cohesion policy resources and encouraging complementary national funding to prevent duplication, streamline financial flows, and concentrate support on clearly defined strategic priorities.</li></ul>\n<p>Most of the funding for the goals of the Action Plan will come from already existing programmes, such as the European Defence Fund (EDF), the European Defence Industry Programme (EDIP), the SAFE instrument (Security Action for Europe), the European Innovation Council (EIC), the EU Disruptive Innovation Scheme (EUDIS), the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI). In the medium term, the defence, resilience and security window of the forthcoming European Competitiveness Fund (ECF) will also support the goals of this Action Plan.</p><p>In this context, Commissioner for Defence and Space, Andrius Kubilius, noted, \"With the launch of this Action Plan, we are turning the concept of a \u2018Drone Wall\u2019 from a political vision into an industrial reality. To achieve true defence readiness, Europe must be able to protect its borders and critical sites with a sophisticated, multi-layered shield that can detect and neutralise any threat in real-time. Commission is developing a range of tools to the industry and Member States to develop and acquire drone and anti-drone defence capabilities in Europe. This includes the Eastern Flank Watch initiative and European Drone Defence Initiative. By bridging the gap between innovative civilian technology and military requirements, we are ensuring that our defence industry can produce these essential systems at the scale and speed required to keep Europe secure and technologically sovereign.'</p>"

The loan will finance the renovation of a plant and the construction of a battery energy storage systems factory in Itaja\u00ed. The beneficiary is a Brazilian electronic components manufacturer specialising in the production of battery energy storage systems.</p><p>According to the press release, the new unit will have a production capacity of 2 GWh per year and will introduce cell-to-pack assembly technology to maximise battery performance. The project includes the creation of a testing laboratory and a power substation, and is expected to create 90 new jobs. The financial resources come from the BNDES More Innovation credit line, which is subject to local content incentives (see related intervention). Moreover, this is the first project contracted under the Public Call for Selection of Business Plans for Investments in the Transformation of Strategic Minerals for Energy Transition and Decarbonization - Joint BNDES-Finep Promotion Action (see related state act).</p><p>In this context, the BNDES President, Aloizio Mercadante, noted: \"This project has strategic importance for Brazil. It is another step in the decarbonisation agenda, contributing to strengthening energy security, increasing the resilience of the electricity grid, and expanding renewable energy sources. Under the guidance of President Lula, Brazil is building a new cycle of development, with innovation and sustainability\" (own translation).</p>"

            "text": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On January 22, 2018, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announced that President Trump has approved recommendations to impose safeguard tariffs on imported residential washing machines (as well as solar cells and modules), based on the investigations, findings, and recommendations of the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC). The restrictions will be imposed for three years on the following schedule:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tariff-Rate Quotas on Washers <br />Year 1:<br />20% on the first 1.2 million units of imported finished washers; 50% on all subsequent imports of finished washers; 50% tariff on covered parts after the first 50,000 units&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Year 2:<br />18% on the first 1.2 million units of imported finished washers; 45% on all subsequent imports of finished washers; 45% tariff on covered parts after the first 70,000 units&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Year 3:<br />16% on the first 1.2 million units of imported finished washers; 40% on all subsequent imports of finished washers; 40% tariff on covered parts after the first 90,000 units&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The restrictions came into effect on February 7, 2018.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Together with the solar cells and modules case, this&nbsp;is the first time that the United States has resorted to the global safeguard since invoking that \"escape clause\" in a 2001 steel case. The restrictions imposed then, like nearly&nbsp;all other uses of the safeguard by all countries since the World Trade Organization came into existence in 1995, was found in a WTO dispute-settlement panel to have violated the terms of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards. It is widely expected that this latest&nbsp;case will lead to a similar challenge. If that challenge is successful (as is widely expected), the United States will need to decide if it will comply with its WTO obligations by bringing these restrictions to an end. Taking into accouint the usual pace of such cases, this finding might reasonably be expected while the restrictions are in their second year.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This case began on 13 June 2017 when the USITC initiated a safeguard investigation of large residential washers. This investigation came in response to a petition filed by the Whirlpool Corporation. The commission determined that this investigation is &ldquo;extraordinarily complicated,&rdquo; and would make its injury determination by October 5, 2017.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On 21 November 2017, the commission announced the remedy recommendations that it will forward to the president. The Commissioners unanimously recommend a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) on imports of large residential washers for a duration of three years.&nbsp; For U.S. imports of large residential washers that exceed 1.2 million units, the Commissioners recommend a tariff rate of 50 percent ad valorem, in addition to the current rate of duty.&nbsp; They recommend that the in-quota volume remain constant throughout and that the above-quota tariff rate decrease by five percentage points during each year of the remedy period.&nbsp; Chairman Schmidtlein and Commissioner Williamson additionally recommend an in-quota tariff rate of 20 percent ad valorem, which would decrease to 18 percent in the second year of the remedy period and 15 percent in the third year of the period, in addition to the current rate of duty.&nbsp; Vice Chairman Johanson and Commissioner Broadbent do not recommend an in-quota tariff rate for large residential washers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On 15 February 2019, the United States International Trade Commission announced the initiation of a review of the definitive duty imposed on imports of the subject good.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On 21 January 2021, the US President issued a proclamation extending the safeguard measure imposed on imports of large residential washing machines following the conclusion of the review. The tariff rate quota is maintained with an in-quota volume level of 1.2 million&nbsp;units, an in-quota tariff rate of 15% in the fourth year, decreasing to 14% in the fifth year, and an above-quota tariff rate of 35% in the fourth year, decreasing to 30% in the&nbsp;fifth year.&nbsp;The proclamation extending the safeguard measure for two years entered into force on 8 February 2021.</p>"
