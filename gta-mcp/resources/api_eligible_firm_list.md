# Eligible Firm Categories

This classification indicates which types of firms are eligible for or targeted by an intervention.

| eligible_firm_id | eligible_firm_name | eligible_firm_description |
|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1 | all | Universal policies that apply to all firms regardless of size, ownership, or sector. Example: a general import tariff applies to all importers; a national minimum wage law applies to all employers. |
| 2 | SMEs | Policies specifically targeting small and medium enterprises, typically defined by employee count or annual turnover thresholds. Example: an SME export credit guarantee programme subsidising trade finance for firms with fewer than 250 employees; reduced regulatory compliance costs for small businesses. |
| 3 | firm-specific | Policies targeting a named company or small group of specifically identified companies. Example: US sanctions on Huawei Technologies prohibiting component sales; subsidies to Tesla for a new gigafactory in Germany; bailout of a specific airline during COVID-19. |
| 4 | state-controlled | Policies targeting state-owned enterprises or enterprises with significant government ownership stakes. Example: requirements for SOE governance reform as a condition for market access; restrictions on state-controlled enterprises bidding for infrastructure contracts; preferential lending rates for government-owned banks. |
| 5 | state trading enterprise | Policies targeting designated state trading entities that have special import/export privileges granted by law (often in agriculture, minerals, or energy). Example: regulations on China's COFCO (state grain trading company); rules governing Canada's wheat board monopoly powers; restrictions on petroleum imports by national oil companies. |
| 6 | sector-specific | Policies targeting all firms in a particular industry, regardless of size or ownership. Example: subsidies for all domestic semiconductor manufacturers; bailout fund for all airlines during pandemic; mandatory cybersecurity audits for all financial services firms. |
| 7 | location-specific | Policies targeting firms in a particular geographic area, such as development zones, border regions, or economically disadvantaged areas. Example: Special Economic Zone tax incentives for firms operating in Shenzhen; reduced VAT rates for firms in Italian southern regions; development grants for businesses in Northern Ireland. |
| 8 | processing trade | Policies targeting firms engaged in processing trade (importing materials duty-free for re-export after processing/assembly). Example: duty exemptions for firms in Mexican maquiladora zones importing US components for assembly and re-export; bonded warehouse schemes in China for electronics processing; export processing zone benefits in Bangladesh garment sector. |

## Usage Notes

- Multiple eligible firm categories can apply to the same intervention (e.g., an SME support programme limited to a specific region would be both category 2 and category 7)
- Category 1 ("all") is most common for broadly applicable trade measures like tariffs and quotas
- Categories 3-5 involve selectivity based on ownership or political connections, often raising subsidy or state aid concerns
- Category 8 is particularly important in global value chain analysis, as processing trade accounts for significant shares of developing country exports

## Why This Matters

Eligible firm categorisation helps identify:
- Whether measures discriminate between domestic and foreign firms (national treatment violations)
- Whether measures constitute selective subsidies (WTO subsidy disciplines apply differently)
- Whether measures distort competition (firm-specific benefits raise competition policy concerns)
- Whether measures target politically connected firms (governance and transparency issues)
