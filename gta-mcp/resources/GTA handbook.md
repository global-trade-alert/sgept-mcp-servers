# **On the Scope and Content of the GTA Database** {#on-the-scope-and-content-of-the-gta-database}

The Global Trade Alert captures unilateral government interventions that alter competitive conditions between foreign and domestic commercial interests. This monitoring system documents policy changes across trade, investment, and labour migration since November 2008\. The database provides empirical evidence of how governments actually behave in trade policy.

Each entry represents a documented departure from the status quo affecting foreign commercial interests. Users can track both liberalising and harmful policy changes across all levels of government intervention.

## Coverage and Scope {#coverage-and-scope}

The GTA documents government announcements that imply credible changes in the treatment of foreign versus domestic commercial interests. Coverage extends from traditional tariffs to behind-the-border regulations affecting services, investment rules, and procurement practices. The database includes decisions by central governments, subnational authorities, public corporations, state financial institutions and firms.

The database captures both liberalising measures and harmful interventions that discriminate against foreign commercial interests. The monitoring framework excludes changes negotiated within bilateral or multilateral trade agreements. Coverage focuses exclusively on unilateral government decisions reflecting discretionary policy space.

## Commercial Activities Monitored {#commercial-activities-monitored}

Three categories of cross-border economic activity fall within the database scope. Trade in goods and services covers everything from agricultural products to digital services. Investment includes greenfield and brownfield foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, and related capital flows. Labour force migration documentation covers how governments alter conditions for foreign workers entering domestic markets.

## Documentation Standards {#documentation-standards}

Each database entry uses official documentation from the implementing authority whenever possible. The GTA relies on consistent reporting from multiple independent sources when official statements remain unavailable. All entries undergo a rigorous two-stage review before publication to prevent the inclusion of rumoured policies or misinterpreted announcements.

## Historical Foundation {#historical-foundation}

The November 2008 starting point anchors monitoring in G20 leaders' explicit commitment to avoid protectionist crisis responses. This baseline allows assessment of how governments have honoured crisis-era pledges over time. The database captures post-crisis policy landscapes that fundamentally reshaped global trade governance through industrial policies, state aid measures, and regulatory interventions.

## Analytical Applications {#analytical-applications}

The database provides empirical foundations for understanding trade policy practice rather than theory. Academic researchers test hypotheses about protectionism drivers and effects. Government officials benchmark policies against international practices and assess retaliation risks. Business users anticipate market access changes, evaluate supply chain risks, and identify commercial opportunities from policy shifts.

The comprehensive scope reveals patterns invisible in traditional trade statistics or formal barrier inventories. These insights prove particularly valuable for understanding the operationalisation of modern trade policy from industrial policy, procurement practices, and regulatory measures.

# **Regarding the State Act Relevance Assessment** {#regarding-the-state-act-relevance-assessment}

The Global Trade Alert employs seven criteria to determine whether government interventions warrant inclusion in the database. These conditions ensure systematic coverage of meaningful policy changes. They maintain an analytical focus on unilateral government actions that alter competitive conditions between foreign and domestic commercial interests.

Each documented intervention must satisfy all seven conditions simultaneously. This framework prevents the inclusion of speculative policies, multilateral agreements, or trivial regulatory adjustments. It captures the full spectrum of discriminatory government actions affecting international commerce.

## **Condition 1: Unilateral Action** {#condition-1:-unilateral-action}

The database exclusively documents unilateral government interventions that deliberately tilt the playing field to benefit or harm foreign commercial interests. Bilateral, plurilateral, or multilateral agreements fall outside the database scope regardless of their commercial impact. This restriction focuses analysis on discretionary policy choices rather than negotiated commitments.

Multilateral trade agreements like new FTAs, WTO Information Technology Agreement implementations, and changes implementing WTO accession protocols remain excluded from coverage. However, unilateral deviations from existing international commitments qualify for inclusion when they discriminate against foreign commercial interests. This distinction captures how governments exercise policy autonomy within established international frameworks.

## **Condition 2: Relative Treatment Test** {#condition-2:-relative-treatment-test}

Documented interventions must demonstrably alter the relative treatment of domestic commercial interests vis-à-vis foreign competitors. The intervention must discriminate against foreign commercial entities in favour of at least one rival with operations in the implementing jurisdiction. Economy-wide competitiveness measures that affect all operators equally fail the Relative Treatment Test regardless of their international trade effects. 

The assessment for inclusion in the database relies on explicit policy text with logical inferences drawn from sources rather than speculative interpretation. De facto discrimination cases require exceptionally strong documentation demonstrating clear differential treatment patterns.

This test excludes horizontal economic policies like general infrastructure investment or broad-based tax reforms that improve overall business conditions. These policies must specifically favour domestic over foreign operators to qualify for inclusion.

## **Condition 3: Meaningful Change** {#condition-3:-meaningful-change}

Interventions must create meaningful alterations to international commercial flows in goods, services, investment, or labour migration. State acts that merely prolong earlier interventions without meaningful change warrant database updates rather than new entries.

Financial incentives, including subsidies, bailouts, and state aid, require minimum volumes exceeding USD 10 million for general programmes. Interventions targeting exclusively SMEs require volumes exceeding USD 100 million. For financial incentives involving loans, thresholds apply to loan volumes rather than government expenditure.

Trivial regulatory compliance cost changes, like minor licensing fee adjustments or paperwork modifications, fall below the Meaningful Change threshold. The assessment focuses on interventions likely to influence commercial decision-making rather than administrative convenience.

## **Condition 4: Credible Action** {#condition-4:-credible-action}

The database documents implemented policies or those with enacted future implementation timelines. Pending legislative proposals, draft regulations subject to approval processes, and statements of intent without concrete implementation mechanisms remain excluded.

Government announcements must demonstrate Credible Action through specific timelines, budget allocations, or regulatory frameworks. Memoranda of understanding for unspecified future collaboration and general policy speeches lack the implementation credibility required for inclusion.

This condition ensures the database reflects actual policy changes rather than political rhetoric or preliminary policy discussions. These preliminary discussions may never materialise into concrete commercial effects.

## **Condition 5: Absence of Uncontested Higher Motive** {#condition-5:-absence-of-uncontested-higher-motive}

The database excludes interventions motivated by uncontested higher motives that enjoy multilateral recognition as legitimate policy objectives. These exclusions acknowledge that some government actions serve purposes superior to maintaining seamless international commerce.

The following four categories of uncontested higher motives warrant exclusion based on multilateral codification:

* Technical barriers to trade notified under WTO TBT procedures reflect legitimate standards harmonisation efforts.   
* Sanitary and phytosanitary measures notified under WTO SPS procedures address recognised health and safety concerns.  
* United Nations Security Council sanctions represent multilaterally endorsed responses to international security threats.   
* Measures implementing the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species reflect globally accepted environmental protection priorities.

Contested higher motives like disputed national security claims or questionable environmental justifications do not warrant exclusion. The database includes such measures, documenting stated government motivations for analytical transparency.

## **Condition 6: One Announcement, One Entry** {#condition-6:-one-announcement,-one-entry}

All qualifying interventions covered within a single government announcement receive documentation within the same database entry. This approach prevents artificial fragmentation of coordinated policy packages. It maintains analytical coherence.

Complex announcements containing multiple policy instruments receive comprehensive documentation that captures their full scope. Separate database entries apply only when distinct announcements introduce unrelated interventions with different implementation timelines or legal frameworks.

## **Condition 7: GTA Monitoring Period** {#condition-7:-gta-monitoring-period}

The monitoring period encompasses interventions where meaningful change occurs after November 1, 2008\. G20 leaders pledged to avoid protectionist responses to the global financial crisis on this date. This temporal boundary anchors the database in a specific historical commitment. It captures post-crisis policy evolution.

Updates to existing measures require that the original intervention fall within the GTA monitoring period. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage of policy developments. It maintains historical consistency in the database foundation.

# **About the GTA Taxonomy** {#about-the-gta-taxonomy}

## Our Units of Analysis: The State Act and the Intervention {#our-units-of-analysis:-the-state-act-and-the-intervention}

The GTA's primary unit of analysis is the state act that represents the announcement of a policy action. Each state act has the following attributes: title, description, announcement date, source and intervention(s). The state act represents the biggest unit of analysis of the dataset.

An intervention represents the specific policy instruments used in the policy action announced. Each state act contains at least one intervention but may include multiple interventions. The scenarios that can lead to multiple interventions are

* If various policy instruments are announced together  
* If the same instrument has both liberalising and harmful effects   
* If the policy action affects different trading partners with different intensities  
* If the policy action affects different eligible firms at different intensities  
* If the policy action refers to several different policy regimes that have their own application rules

  ## The State Act Taxonomy at a Glance {#the-state-act-taxonomy-at-a-glance}

Variables that work at the state act level imply that they apply to all the policy interventions recorded within that state act. The following variables work at the state act level:

* **Title:** Short description of the documented policy action. It always lists the implementing jurisdiction.  
* **Description:** Summary of the documented policy action.  
* **Source:** Official statement(s) with proper citation format. When no official statement is available, the state act lists at least two different independent sources confirming the policy action.   
* **Announcement date:** The date the decision was announced.  
* **State act evaluation:** Identifies if the policy action is likely to liberalise or restrict trade. 

  ## The Intervention Taxonomy at a Glance {#the-intervention-taxonomy-at-a-glance}

The intervention level structures the information it collects along three primary axes:

1. **Information on the implementer of the action**: This section examines the specifics of the entities responsible for implementing trade and industrial-related policies. It covers the following:  
   1. Implementing Jurisdiction: The geographical and political scope of the agency implementing the policy.   
   2. Implementation Level: The government level executing the policy (subnational, national, supranational, NFI, IFI).  
2. **Information on the substance of the policy instrument:** This section focuses on the nature and scope of the policy actions themselves. It encompasses the following:  
   1. Intervention description: Complete details of the policy change  
   2. Intervention type: Type of policy instrument (import tariff, export ban, etc.).   
   3. Affected flow: Identifies if imports or exports are affected  
   4. GTA evaluation: Identifies if an intervention liberalises or restricts trade  
   5. Inception date: When the policy was enforced  
   6. Removal date: When the policy ended  
   7. Eligible firms: Target firms (all, SMEs, firm-specific, etc.)  
   8. Is horizontal: To signal that no specific economic sector is affected  
   9. Products: The specific goods that are targeted by the policy action  
   10. Sectors: The economic sectors that are targeted by the policy action  
3. **Information on the affected trading partner(s):** This section identifies the trading partners that are affected by the policy action.  
   1. Affected jurisdiction: Countries whose commercial interests are affected by the policy action.   
   2. Distorted market: Countries where market conditions change due to the policy action. 

This taxonomy serves as a vital tool for government officials, policy professionals, researchers and media, providing a clear and structured means to access and analyse policies affecting international commerce and industrial policy efficiently and effectively. Each section in the following handbook will describe these dimensions, including field values and descriptions, and provide examples when relevant.

# **Information on the Implementer Profile** {#information-on-the-implementer-profile}

This section of the Global Trade Alert (GTA) taxonomy is dedicated to detailing the entities behind trade and industrial policies. It provides a systematic breakdown of two different facets of the implementer, offering clarity on who is responsible for the trade instrument described in each intervention. 

## Implementing jurisdiction {#implementing-jurisdiction}

The implementing jurisdiction refers to the geographical and political scope within which a regulatory authority operates. The GTA use the official names of jurisdictions worldwide as used by the United Nations Statistics Office. For subnational units, we use the common name in the English language.

## Implementation level {#implementation-level}

The implementation level designates which government level or agency is responsible for the government action. This dimension is essential for identifying the scope and scale at which trade and industrial policies are implemented. It distinguishes whether a policy is local, regional, national, or international and whether the implementer is a governmental institution or a public financing bank. Understanding the implementation level of a policy aids in assessing its impact and relevance across different geographical areas.

The different implementation level values used by the GTA team are:

* **Supranational:** Announcements by supranational bodies with binding consequences for their member states. Examples include the European Commission as well as the steering bodies of customs unions.  
* **National:** Announcements made by central government agencies, including the central bank.  
* **Subnational:** Announcements made by lower levels of government, such as regional, state, provincial and municipal governments.  
* **National Financial Institution (NFI):** Announcements made by a publicly owned bank, such as the National Development Bank or Export-Import Bank. GTA-relevant central bank announcements are subsumed as part of the national level.  
* **International Financial Institution (IFI):** Announcements made by a publicly owned bank with more than one shareholding member state. 

At the GTA, we always report the final governmental implementer, i.e. if the Ministry of Economy announces a loan scheme and says that the National Development Bank will manage the applications and provide the funds, NFI would appear in the implementation level.

# **Information on the Substance of the Policy Instrument** {#information-on-the-substance-of-the-policy-instrument}

This section of the GTA taxonomy provides a comprehensive overview of the various aspects of policy instruments within the policy action. It is structured to offer a detailed understanding of the nature, tools, and scope of policy initiatives.

## Intervention description {#intervention-description}

The intervention description provides all the information needed to understand the potential impact of the described government action. It summarises the essential features of the policy action and provides additional context supporting the taxonomy choices. 

## Intervention type {#intervention-type}

The intervention type refers to the policy instrument employed by regulatory authorities to achieve their policy objectives. Policy instruments are grouped under different categories, with non-tariff measures following the [UNCTAD’s MAST chapter grouping](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/ditctab2019d5_en.pdf)[^1]

### Non-tariff Measures

#### Sanitary and phytosanitary measures \- MAST chapter A

The sanitary and phytosanitary measures group encompasses interventions falling under the trade instrument **sanitary and phytosanitary measure**. Such interventions aim to protect human, animal, or plant life and health from risks associated with food contaminants, pests, and diseases. The GTA team excludes measures notified under WTO SPS procedures as they fail the reporting condition 5 (absence of higher motive).

#### Technical barriers to trade \- MAST chapter B

The technical barriers to trade measures group covers the trade instrument **technical barriers to trade**. Such regulations impose mandatory standards on products and their production methods, including requirements related to size, weight, packaging, labelling, marketing, or composition. The GTA team excludes SPS measures notified under WTO TBT procedures as they fail the reporting condition 5 (absence of higher motive).

#### Preshipment inspection and other formalities \- MAST chapter C

This group covers interventions falling under the trade instrument **import monitoring**. These measures refer to regulations adopted to track import flows without restricting market access, allowing goods to enter the domestic market while maintaining oversight of trade patterns. For instance, a government might impose an import monitoring on steel goods that are re-exported to keep track of the origin of imports. 

#### Contingent trade-protective measures \- MAST chapter D

The contingent trade-protective measures chapter encompass instruments that countries deploy to defend their markets against specific import challenges. These measures influence trade flows by providing temporary protection when specific challenges threaten local industries, affecting competitive conditions and market stability.

The GTA team currently distinguishes between the following trade defence instruments:

* **Anti-circumvention:** Measures taken to prevent the evasion of existing trade defence duties through minor alterations to products, shipping through third countries, or other methods designed to avoid the original trade remedy actions.  
* **Anti-dumping**: Investigations and duties imposed when a government determines that foreign products are being sold at prices lower than their normal value in the domestic market, causing injury to local industry. These measures target price discrimination across international markets.  
* **Anti-subsidy**: Measures (typically duties) implemented to counteract the effects of foreign government subsidies provided to producers or exporters in the country of origin. These actions aim to offset the unfair competitive advantage gained through government support.  
* **Safeguards**: Temporary import restrictions imposed in response to sudden surges in imports that cause or threaten serious injury to domestic industries. Unlike anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures, safeguards are applied regardless of whether trade is "fair" or "unfair."  
* **Special safeguards**: Mechanisms allowing for the imposition of additional tariffs when import volumes rise above defined trigger levels or prices fall below specified thresholds. These are typically applied to agricultural products and follow specific rules under trade agreements.

#### Non-automatic import licensing, quotas etc. \- MAST chapter E

This group includes measures that limit the entry of foreign goods into domestic markets, excluding those implemented for sanitary and phytosanitary reasons or technical standards compliance. 

The GTA team currently distinguishes between the following import restriction instruments:

* **Import ban**: Prohibitions on importing specific goods or services into a jurisdiction. These measures completely block market access for the targeted products, representing the most severe form of import restriction.  
* **Import licensing requirement:** Administrative procedures requiring importers to obtain permits or licenses as a precondition for importing certain products. These requirements can function as quantitative restrictions or serve to monitor and control the flow of specific imports.  
* **Import quota:** Restrictions that set physical limits on the quantity or value of goods that can be imported during a specified period. Import quotas create artificial scarcity of foreign products in the domestic market, typically raising prices and limiting consumer access.  
* **Import tariff quota:** Hybrid measures that combine quotas and tariffs, where imports within a specified quantity can enter at a lower duty rate, while imports exceeding that quantity face a higher tariff. These instruments allow controlled market access while still providing protection to domestic industries.  
* **Voluntary export-restraint arrangements:** Policy actions securing voluntary export quantity commitments from trading partners to limit shipments to specific markets, preventing trade restrictions through negotiated volume controls rather than imposed border measures.

#### Price control measures, including additional taxes and charges \- MAST chapter F

This group encloses instruments that manipulate import prices to support domestic markets, stabilise price fluctuations, or generate government revenue. These measures influence trade competitiveness by adjusting the cost structure of foreign goods, affecting market dynamics and fiscal outcomes. 

The GTA team currently distinguishes between the following instruments:

* **Import price benchmark:** Policy actions establishing benchmark prices that customs authorities use to verify declared import values and calculate duties. They seek to prevent under-invoicing and protect domestic markets from under-priced imports. For instance, by setting a specific import reference value.  
* **Internal taxation of imports:** Policy actions related to the domestic taxes applied after customs clearance. For example, eliminating the VAT on imported goods.   
* **Minimum import price:** Policy actions establishing minimum price thresholds that prevent importation of goods below specified levels, blocking market access for underpriced products rather than adjusting duty calculations. For example, regulations establishing a minimum import price.   
* **Other import charges:** Policy actions imposing additional border charges beyond standard tariffs to influence import impacts through price stabilisation, seasonal protection, or revenue generation. This includes variable duties, customs surcharges, seasonal tariffs, and government service fees applied before customs clearance. For example, a policy establishing a 5% additional duty when imports of corn are below a certain price threshold.   
* **Voluntary export-price restraints:** Policy actions securing voluntary export price commitments from trading partners to maintain minimum pricing levels, preventing trade restrictions through negotiated price floors rather than imposed border measures.

#### Finance measures \- MAST chapter G

The finance measures group covers the trade instrument **trade payment measures**. These measures refer to regulations dictating how international trade payments must be conducted. This includes requirements to use specific currencies for transactions above certain thresholds or mandating particular payment timelines for imports or exports. Policy actions falling under this instrument influence how payments for cross-border trade are conducted, affecting currency exchange and payment terms.

#### Trade-related investment measures \- MAST chapter I 

This group encloses instruments that require or incentivise the use of domestic resources in production and business operations. These measures influence how companies incorporate local elements into their activities, affecting trade flows and investment decisions. 

The GTA team currently distinguishes between the following instruments:

* **Local content incentive:** Regulations offering voluntary subsidy arrangements in exchange for commitments to use domestically produced inputs. For example, providing tax relief to automakers who incorporate a minimum threshold of locally-manufactured steel in their vehicles.  
* **Local content requirements:** Regulations imposing the use of locally produced inputs in manufacturing. For example, requiring that vehicles produced domestically must incorporate a minimum percentage of locally manufactured components.  
* **Local labour incentive:** Policy actions offering voluntary subsidy arrangements in exchange for commitments to maintain or increase domestic employment. For example, providing financial support to companies that pledge to maintain current local workforce levels.  
* **Local labour requirements:** Regulations mandating the employment of domestic workers, either by restricting foreign hiring or by imposing specific localisation thresholds for national participation in projects.  
* **Local operations incentive:** Regulations offering voluntary subsidy arrangements in exchange for commitments to maintain or establish operations domestically. For example, the elimination of land tax for companies that establish new manufacturing facilities within national borders.  
* **Local operations requirements:** Policy actions requiring specific business activities to be carried out within the domestic territory. For example, requirements that personal data must be stored on local servers.  
* **Local value added incentive:** Regulations offering voluntary subsidy arrangements in exchange for commitments to incorporate minimum thresholds of domestic value in products. For example, offering a financial grant to manufacturers incorporating at least 50% of local value based on labour costs or domestically produced inputs.  
* **Local value added requirements:** Regulations imposing the incorporation of a certain minimum percentage of local value-added in manufacturing and end product/service. The added value can come in the form of inputs, labour, operations and/or services originating in the country. For example, the requirement that PV cells produced in the country must incorporate X% of additional value-added originating from the country.  
* **Trade balancing measure:** Regulations that link import permissions to export performance, such as allowing companies to import materials only up to a certain percentage of their export earnings.

#### Subsidies \- MAST chapter L

The subsidies measures group encompasses instruments that involve financial transfers to beneficiaries in the domestic market of the implementing government. These measures create advantages for recipients through various forms of direct and indirect support. 

The GTA team currently distinguishes between the following subsidy measure instruments:

* **Capital injection and equity stakes:** Government financial support through the acquisition of equity in firms, including rescue operations or bailouts that involve the state taking ownership positions in distressed companies.  
* **Financial grant:** Non-repayable funding provided to beneficiaries, excluding cases where the support mechanism would constitute a production subsidy.  
* **Import incentive:** Direct or indirect support mechanisms specifically designed to promote the importation of certain goods or services.  
* **In-kind grant:** Non-monetary asset subsidies such as government provision of land, buildings, or infrastructure to specific firms or sectors to promote investment or development.  
* **Interest payment subsidy:** Government payments that reduce the interest rate burden on loans, where the state covers a portion of the interest without directly providing the underlying loan.  
* **Loan guarantee:** State assumption of default risk for loans issued by third parties to domestic entities, including insurance coverage or similar trade guarantees.  
* **Localisation, nes:** Government payments that enable consumer purchases of specific goods, conditional on those goods being locally produced.  
* **Price stabilisation:** Public sector actions to control or stabilise the prices of specific goods or services by offering minimum purchase prices on specific goods.  
* **Production subsidy:** Direct financial support scaled according to production activities, either linked to the quantity produced or by providing monetary or non-monetary assets related to production inputs.  
* **State loan:** Loans issued directly or indirectly by the government with preferential interest rates.   
* **Tax or social insurance relief:** Selective tax reductions or rebates on income tax, social security contributions, VAT, import tariffs, or other tax obligations that provide targeted benefits.  
* **State aid, nes:** Governmental support that cannot be classified under any other subsidy instrument category.  
* **State aid, unspecified:** Financial support referenced in government actions where the specific type or form is unclear.

#### Government procurement restrictions \- MAST chapter M

The government procurement restrictions measure group encompasses instruments that create barriers for foreign bidders attempting to sell products and services to government entities. These measures influence how public procurement processes operate, affecting foreign companies' access to government contracts. 

The GTA team currently distinguishes between the following government procurement restriction instruments:

* **Public procurement access:** Measures that modify conditions under which foreign companies can participate in government tenders. For example, limiting foreign access to contracts below certain monetary thresholds or excluding foreign participation in specific industry sectors.  
* **Public procurement localisation:** Requirements that mandate bidders to source components or services locally. For example, by establishing that a percentage of the good's value needs to come from local producers.  
* **Public procurement preference margin:** Mechanisms that provide cost advantages to domestic bidders. For example, applying percentage adjustments that artificially improve local bids during evaluation.  
* **Public procurement, nes:** Restrictions on foreign bidders in government tenders that cannot be classified under any of the other public procurement instruments.

#### Intellectual property \- MAST chapter N

This group covers interventions falling under the trade instrument **intellectual property protection**. These measures refer to regulations that establish or modify the protection of intellectual assets, including patents, trademarks, industrial designs, layout designs of integrated circuits, copyrights, geographical indications, and trade secrets. Policy actions falling under this instrument influence how intellectual assets are protected and utilised in cross-border contexts, affecting innovation, technology transfer, and market access. 

#### Export-related measures (including subsidies) \- MAST chapter P

The export-related measures group comprises instruments that are applied to exported goods and services by the government of the exporting country. These measures influence how domestic products are sold in foreign markets, affecting trade flows. 

The GTA team currently distinguishes between the following export-related measure instruments:

* **Export ban:** Prohibitions on the exportation of specific goods or services, excluding those linked to technical barriers to trade or sanitary concerns.  
* **Export licensing requirement:** Administrative procedures requiring submission of applications or documentation as a prior condition for exporting goods or services, going beyond standard customs requirements.  
* **Export price benchmark:** Restrictions that establish price benchmarks for exported goods to verify declared values and calculate applicable export taxes, whether implemented through reference pricing or minimum price thresholds.  
* **Export quota:** Restrictions that establish physical limits on the quantity of goods that can be exported, whether measured by value or volume.  
* **Export tariff quota:** Export regimes where quantities within a quota are typically subject to lower export tax rates than those outside the quota.  
* **Export tax:** Taxes charged by authorities on the exportation of goods and services, calculated either on a per-unit basis or on the value of the exported item.  
* **Export-related non-tariff measures, nes:** Regulations facilitating or restricting exports that cannot be classified in any other export intervention type, excluding subsidy-like policy actions. For example, permitting/restricting exports through certain ports.  
* **Foreign customer limit:** Bans or limits imposed on domestic companies regarding the provision of specific services to foreigners.  
* **Local supply requirement for exports:** Restrictions that link export permissions to the fulfilment of domestic supply requirements. For example, mandating that a percentage of production must be sold in the local market to obtain a permit to export.  
* **Export subsidy:** Direct or indirect financial support scaled on the basis of export activities, designed to increase exports through mechanisms other than tax advantages.  
* **Financial assistance in foreign market**: Support granted to domestic companies for establishing or expanding physical presence abroad. For example providing funds for the acquisition of foreign companies.  
* **Trade finance:** Financing instruments provided to support export or import transactions involving domestically produced goods or services, typically offered by export-import banks or other government entities.  
* **Tax-based export incentive:** Export incentives provided through tax credits or rebates, where the government eliminates or reduces taxes specifically to encourage exports.  
* **Other export incentive:** Export promotion measures not covered by other instruments, for example, granting support for advertising abroad.

### Other Intervention Types

#### Tariffs 

The tariff group encompasses interventions falling under the **import tariff** trade instrument. An import tariff is a tax charged by the customs authority on importing goods and services into a country.

#### Capital control measures

The capital controls policy area encompasses regulations governing the flow of money and financial assets across national borders. These measures influence international finance by controlling how funds enter and exit domestic markets, affecting exchange rates, monetary policy effectiveness, and financial stability. 

The GTA team currently distinguishes between the following capital control instruments:

* **Competitive devaluation**: Deliberate currency devaluation policies that make a country's exports more price-competitive in international markets by lowering the relative value of the domestic currency against foreign currencies.  
* **Controls on personal transactions:** Regulations restricting how individuals can move money into and out of the country, including asset freezes and limits on currency transfers. These measures typically target personal financial activities rather than commercial operations.  
* **Controls on commercial transactions and investment instruments**: Rules governing how capital can be used in cross-border commercial transactions, including the acquisition of foreign assets such as shares, derivatives, and debt securities. These measures influence international portfolio investments and financial flows.  
* **Controls on credit operations**: Regulations setting limits on foreign borrowing or lending, including restrictions on how much foreign debt local companies can accumulate and limitations on borrowing in foreign currencies. These measures aim to manage external debt exposure.  
* **Repatriation & surrender requirements**: Rules mandating that foreign currency earnings from international trade must be converted into local currency within specified timeframes. For example, requiring export revenues received in US dollars to be exchanged for domestic currency within 30 days.

#### FDI measures

This group encloses instruments that regulate cross-border investment activities involving greenfield and brownfield projects in foreign markets. These measures influence how investors establish or acquire operations outside their home countries, affecting capital flows and investment decisions. 

The GTA team currently distinguishes between the following instruments:

* **FDI: entry and ownership rule:** Policy actions changing the conditions or amending procedures to access a foreign market and/or to purchase or own fully or partially a company in the implementing jurisdiction.  
* **FDI: Financial incentive:** Regulations granting financial support to promote foreign investments in the implementing jurisdiction. This financial support may be granted in a direct form (i.e. a financial grant) or indirect (i.e. an import tariff concession).   
* **FDI: Treatment and operations, nes:** Policy interventions changing the conditions in which a foreign investor is treated in the implementing jurisdiction or changes the conditions on how the foreign investor conducts its business post-entry. This intervention type also includes all FDI interventions not classified elsewhere.

#### Migration measures 

The migration measures group encompasses instruments that affect the foreign labour force of a country. These measures regulate the cross-border movement of workers and the conditions under which foreign workers operate after entry into a market. 

The GTA team currently distinguishes between the following migration measure instruments:

* **Labour market access:** Regulations that modify conditions for workers entering/exiting the domestic labour market. For example, changes to foreign working visa accessibility.  
* **Post-migration treatment:** Measures that alter how foreign workers are treated after they have been granted access to the country. For example, changes to tax treatment or investment rights.

#### Instrument unclear

The instrument unclear measures group encloses policy actions that meet reporting criteria for the GTA database but lack sufficient detail for precise classification. These measures represent government interventions where the specific form or mechanism is ambiguous or falls outside established categories. 

The GTA team currently distinguishes between the following instrument unclear measure instruments:

* **Instrument unclear:** Government actions that qualify for reporting but have unclear implementation mechanisms due to limited details in official documentation, preventing precise classification.  
* **Import-related non-tariff measure, nes:** Regulations imposing specific procedural, operational, or distribution requirements on imported goods that cannot be classified under other intervention types. These measures include but are not limited to requirements for imports to pass through designated customs ports, restrictions limiting trade to state enterprises, mandates for local distribution channels, or requirements that after-sales services be provided by domestic companies. For example, requiring live animal imports through a single customs office, limiting commodity trading to government-owned enterprises, restricting retail distribution to nationals, or mandating local provision of after-sales services for imported equipment.

## Affected flow {#affected-flow}

The affected commercial flow field identifies whether the intervention primarily affects the imports or exports of the implementer or the exporters of third countries. The affected flow impacts the results displayed as affected jurisdictions and distorted markets. There are three potential values. Only one value can be assigned to each intervention. 

* **Inward:** The predominantly distorted market is the domestic market of the implementing jurisdiction, and the affected jurisdictions are those exporting towards that jurisdiction.  
* **Outward:** The predominantly affected and distorted market is the outflow destination.  
* **Outward subsidy:** The predominantly distorted market is the outflow destination, but the predominantly affected markets are those whose exporters compete with those of the distorted market. Exclusively used for subsidies classified under MAST chapter P.

## GTA evaluation {#gta-evaluation}

The GTA evaluation field designates the direction of impact the documented policy change has on foreign commercial interests. This dimension identifies whether trade policies create barriers or enhance market access for international competitors. It distinguishes between measures that discriminate against foreign entities and those that liberalise markets on a non-discriminatory basis.

The GTA evaluation field can take three possible values: 

* **Green:** Liberalises trade on a non-discriminatory basis   
* **Red:** Almost certainly discriminates against foreign commercial interests  
* **Amber:** Likely involves discrimination against foreign commercial interests.  

Depending on the GTA evaluation, interventions are grouped into two groups: liberalising and harmful. 

### Liberalising interventions

The liberalising group englobes all those policy interventions that facilitate the access of foreign commercial interests into the market of the implementing jurisdiction. Interventions classified as green fall under this group. 

### Harmful interventions

The harmful group encompasses all interventions that raise trade barriers, discriminating between domestic and foreign actors. This group includes interventions with red and amber evaluations. 

## Inception date {#inception-date}

The inception date designates when the documented policy change was enforced or implemented. This dimension is essential for identifying the scope at which trade policies take effect in markets. It distinguishes between when a policy was merely announced and when it actually began impacting commercial interests. Understanding the inception date of a policy aids in assessing its timeline and determining exactly when market conditions changed as a result of the intervention.

## Removal date {#removal-date}

The removal date field identifies when the reported policy action was withdrawn or replaced. When selected, it delimits the effects of the policy action on market access. The removal date of a policy helps assess its timeline and determines exactly when market conditions changed as a result of the intervention.

## Last update date {#last-update-date}

The last update date field identifies when content-related modifications were applied to an existing intervention entry. The last update date helps track non-meaningful changes affecting policies over time and determines when such additional information was included in the database. An example of such a content-related update is a government announcement extending the duration of a temporary export quota. This scenario would trigger an update to the removal date field, as this change provides relevant information about policy evolution while failing to meet the threshold for creating a new intervention entry.

## Eligible firms {#eligible-firms}

This taxonomy field identifies the specific types of businesses that are targeted/affected by the policy intervention. This dimension is essential for identifying the scope and scale at which trade and industrial policies impact the economy. It distinguishes whether a policy affects all business actors or a specific subset (e.g. SMEs, those from a specific region, etc). This taxonomy field supports evaluating the impact and relevance of policy actions for market access purposes.

The GTA team uses the following eligible firms' values:

* **All:** When the policy action applies to all types of companies.  
* **SMEs:** When the policy action applies exclusively to SMEs. This category includes entrepreneurs and start-ups.   
* **Firm-specific:** Policy actions targeting a specific company or specific project.   
* **State-controlled:** Primarily used when a policy action targets all companies with a public ownership stake exceeding 50 per cent. Secondarily, this value is also used when the commercial action only targets public institutions (e.g. a special duty concession to goods imported by governmental bodies). Note that if a policy action only targets one specific state-controlled company, then it is classified as firm-specific.   
* **State trading enterprise:** When interventions target all companies that are majority publicly owned and have special privileges on cross-border transactions, like the monopoly on imports of a staple food.  
* **Sector-specific:** When an intervention affects firms operating in an enumerated economic activity different from the one targeted by the intervention. For example, an import tariff reduction for screws when used by the car industry. The value "sector-specific" signals that not any screw importer receives this tariff reduction, but only those in an enumerated economic activity (car production).   
* **Location-specific:**  When an action refers to firms located in a specific location that differs somehow from the location of the implementer. For example, a national government action that only applies to companies located in one of the regions of the country.  
* **Processing-trade:** When the action targets only companies that import raw materials or intermediary goods, process them locally and export the value-added goods. 

## Is horizontal {#is-horizontal}

The "is horizontal" taxonomy field designates when policy interventions affect the entire economy rather than specific sectors. This dimension is essential for identifying the scope and scale at which trade policies impact the economy. It distinguishes between economy-wide measures and targeted interventions focusing on particular industries or products. Understanding the horizontal nature of a policy helps in assessing its overall economic impact and determining how different sectors may be affected with varying intensity as a result of the intervention. At the GTA, we identify a policy intervention as horizontal when the recorded policy applies across virtually all sectors (or the majority), and its impact will vary in intensity across them. 

## Products {#products}

The product field designates which specific goods are affected by the documented policy change. This dimension is essential for identifying the scope and scale at which trade policies impact specific market segments. It helps users distinguish between broad measures affecting many products and interventions focusing on particular goods. Understanding the product coverage of a policy helps assess its commercial impact and determine how much trade may be distorted as a result of the intervention.

At the GTA, we identify affected products using the 2022 version of the Harmonised System (HS) codes at the 6-digit level, encompassing more than 5’000 different products. Each product is commonly referred to as its own “tariff line”. The details of this classification and its correspondence to others are available from the [World Customs Organisation](https://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/nomenclature/instrument-and-tools/hs-nomenclature-2022-edition.aspx).

In cases where the official source includes product information in the Harmonised System or a related classification, the products are chosen accordingly. In cases where no such information is available, the GTA team chooses the likely tariff lines based on the announcement text and the Harmonised System descriptions. To distinguish whether the selected tariff line is explicitly mentioned in the source or if it was identified by the team, the GTA products section includes the following attributes: 

* **Official tariff line (HS 2022):** When selected, it signals that the official source explicitly identified the affected tariff lines  
* **Official tariff line (converted from HS 2017 or earlier):**   
* **Non-official tariff line**

## Sectors {#sectors}

This taxonomy field designates which economic activities are targeted by the documented policy change. This dimension is essential for identifying the scope and scale at which trade policies affect different parts of the economy. It distinguishes between horizontal measures impacting the entire economy and vertical interventions focusing on specific industries or services. Understanding the sectoral coverage of a policy aids in assessing its broader economic implications and determining exactly which commercial activities may experience changed conditions as a result of the intervention. 

At the GTA, we identify affected economic activities using Common Product Classification (CPC, version 2.1) at the 3-digit level. The details of this classification and its correspondence to others are available from the [United Nations Statistics Division](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/unsdclassifications/cpcv21.pdf).

For interventions that include product-level information, the associated sectors are selected based on the United Nations’ correspondence table for CPC 2.1 and HS 2022\. In all other cases, the sector code is chosen by the GTA team according to the wording of the official source.

# **Information on the Affected Trading Partner(s) Profile** {#information-on-the-affected-trading-partner(s)-profile}

This section of the GTA taxonomy focuses on the jurisdictions affected by the different trade and industrial policies. It provides information on both the affected jurisdiction(s) and the distorted market(s). The database also identifies how trading partners become implicated in GTA database entries.

Understanding these different pathways helps users identify the full scope of jurisdictions affected by a trade barrier, including those that may experience significant commercial impact despite not being explicitly mentioned in the policy text. The classification prevents both over-attribution of government intent and under-identification of affected markets.

## Affected jurisdiction {#affected-jurisdiction}

The affected jurisdiction field identifies the geographical and political areas whose commercial interests are potentially impacted by the documented policy intervention. This dimension is decisive for determining which territories fall within the scope of trade measures and assessing their international reach. Understanding jurisdictional coverage helps in evaluating a policy's market access impact. The affected jurisdiction depends on the trade flow direction as follows:

* For import measures: Countries exporting the specified products to the implementing jurisdiction  
* For export measures: Destinations receiving exports from the implementing jurisdiction  
* For outward subsidies: Competitors operating in the same market segments

## Distorted market {#distorted-market}

The distorted market field specifies which commercial interests will experience altered competitive conditions as a result of the documented policy intervention. This dimension is essential for identifying where economic impacts will manifest and how market dynamics may shift following implementation. Understanding market distortion patterns helps in forecasting potential price changes, supply chain disruptions, and competitive repositioning among market participants. 

## Affected jurisdiction type and distorted market type

The taxonomy presented in this section helps users distinguish precisely how trading partners become implicated in GTA database entries, whether through explicit government targeting, incidental effects from supporting company commercial decisions, analytical inference from trade flow data, or deliberate exclusion from policy scope. 

The following categories capture these distinct mechanisms of trading partner implication:

### Inferred Jurisdiction

This value signals that the jurisdiction was inferred from trade data, taking into account the affected flow. This identification process combines the identified product codes with UN COMTRADE trade statistics for the year prior to the policy change. Trading partners with trade exceeding USD 1 million in the year prior to the policy change are marked as “inferred jurisdiction”. “Inferred jurisdiction” is the most common classification value among GTA database entries.

### Targeted Jurisdiction

This value signals that jurisdictions listed in the Affected Jurisdiction and/or Distorted Market tables are explicitly identified as targets in the policy intervention. This classification indicates that the implementing jurisdiction's policy action has deliberately targeted specific jurisdictions. The targeted jurisdictions are manually added to the relevant table(s) and marked with this classification. Example: An import tariff increase that applies exclusively to goods originating from China would result in China being classified as "targeted" in the Affected Jurisdiction table.

### Excluded Jurisdiction

This value signals that jurisdictions listed in the Affected Jurisdiction and/or Distorted Market tables are explicitly exempted from the policy intervention's scope. This classification indicates that specific jurisdictions have been deliberately excluded from the policy intervention's application, despite otherwise meeting the criteria for inclusion. The excluded jurisdictions are manually removed from the relevant jurisdiction table(s), and the table receives this classification marker. Example: An import tariff increase on steel products that explicitly exempts imports from USMCA partners would result in the table displaying all jurisdictions identified through computational analysis of trade data, excluding the United States, Mexico and Canada and the Affected Jurisdiction table being classified as “excluded jurisdiction”.

### Incidental Jurisdiction

Select "incidental jurisdiction" when the trading partner results from company commercial decisions rather than government market selection. The government policy responds to existing business relationships without directing where trade should (not) flow. This classification applies when trade finance supports a company, when export credit guarantees follow a company's chosen markets, when import facilitation measures support company sourcing decisions, etc.

# **Special Taxonomical Considerations** {#special-taxonomical-considerations}

## Trade defence taxonomy

There are two additional taxonomy fields for documented anti-circumvention, anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard measures. These fields are essential for identifying the procedural stage and duration at which these instruments affect specific market segments. It helps users distinguish between preliminary investigations and definitive measures, and track how long trade defence duties remain in force. Understanding the investigation status of a trade defence measure helps assess its current legal standing and determine the temporal scope of market protection.

At the GTA, we track trade defence investigations using standardised status categories that capture key procedural milestones from initiation through termination. Each investigation progresses through distinct procedural stages corresponding to international trade defence practices established by the WTO. The GTA team distinguishes the following trade defence procedural phases:

* **Initiation:** The formal launch of a trade defence investigation following a petition by the domestic industry or government action, establishing the legal framework and timeline for examining alleged unfair trade practices or import surges.  
* **Preliminary duty imposition:** Temporary duties imposed during the investigation period based on initial evidence of dumping, subsidisation, or injury, providing immediate relief to the domestic industry while the full investigation continues.  
* **Definitive duty announcement:** The final determination and imposition of permanent trade defence measures following completion of the full investigation, establishing the conclusive duty rates and duration.  
* **Sunset reviews:** Periodic examinations conducted before trade defence measures expire to determine whether their removal would likely lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping, subsidisation, or injury. These reviews typically occur five years after initial imposition.  
* **Extensions:** Short-term prolongations of existing trade defence measures beyond their scheduled expiration date, usually implemented while sunset reviews are in progress to maintain protection during the evaluation period.  
* **Renewals:** The continuation of trade defence duties for additional periods following successful sunset reviews that demonstrate the continued need for protection against unfair trade practices or injury.  
* **Final termination:** The complete withdrawal of trade defence measures either due to unsuccessful sunset reviews, changed circumstances, or expiration without renewal, restoring normal trading conditions for the affected products.

In cases where official sources specify investigation dates and status changes, the timeline is recorded accordingly. In cases where no such information is available, the GTA team estimates likely status transitions based on announcement text and standard investigation procedures.

## Duplication of interventions with the same intervention type and GTA evaluation

When policy announcements contain multiple elements that could be classified under the same intervention type and evaluation, the GTA applies specific rules to determine whether these should be reported as separate interventions or consolidated into a single entry. This approach ensures accurate representation of complex policy packages while preventing artificial inflation of intervention counts.

The GTA team distinguishes three scenarios that warrant intervention duplication:

* **Multiple sub-schemes within a single announcement:** Interventions are duplicated when one announcement refers to several "distinguishable acts" that share the same inception date but meet specific differentiation criteria. Duplication occurs when the state act refers to at least two different sub-schemes where at least two of the following conditions are met: each sub-scheme has a different budget allocation, targets different product categories, operates under different regulatory rules, or pursues different policy objectives. The critical requirement is that the same company could potentially qualify for multiple schemes simultaneously, as this creates distinct competitive effects requiring separate analytical treatment. Additionally, interventions are duplicated when the state act involves different implementing agencies (such as combined national and regional government funding) or affects eligible firms at different intensities through separate application procedures or eligibility criteria.  
* **Staggered implementation timelines:** When one announcement refers to multiple policy actions classified under the same intervention type and evaluation but implemented at different dates, the GTA reports these as separate interventions. This rule applies when each action constitutes a "distinguishable act" with distinct implementation timelines that create separate market effects. This differentiation approach recognises that staggered implementation creates distinct periods of market impact, requiring separate analytical treatment to accurately capture the temporal scope and intensity of policy effects on commercial interests.  
* **Differential treatment across trading partners:** When one announcement establishes policy actions that affect different trading partners at varying intensities, the GTA reports these as separate interventions. This rule ensures that differential treatment across jurisdictions receives appropriate analytical representation. For subsidy measures, the "distinguishable act" criteria must additionally be satisfied to warrant duplication, preventing artificial separation of unified policy frameworks that happen to mention multiple trading partners.

This comprehensive differentiation approach ensures that each intervention entry captures a distinct policy mechanism with separate market effects, while avoiding double-counting scenarios where operators cannot be affected by multiple measures simultaneously or where jurisdictional mentions do not reflect substantively different treatment.

## Interpreting empty taxonomy fields 

Missing data can also be interpreted. This section helps users identify why certain taxonomy fields remain empty in GTA database entries. Understanding these information gaps helps in interpreting the analytical scope.

### Missing product/sector/is horizontal data

When an intervention presents the product, sector and “is horizontal” field empty, it signals that no information is available to determine the sectoral scope of the intervention.  

### Missing inception date 

Interventions with no inception date refer to policy processes requiring extended implementation timelines or procedural stages before definitive measures take effect. The GTA currently identifies the following possible policy scenarios:

* **Trade defence-related:** In these cases, a missing inception date signals that no definitive duty has thus far been adopted.  
* **Industrial strategy announcements:** Policy actions launching comprehensive sectoral development plans or strategic frameworks that require subsequent implementing regulations to become operational in specific markets.  
* **Legislative policy proposals:** Policy actions introducing significant regulatory changes through parliamentary or administrative processes that remain subject to approval, modification, or rejection before implementation. This includes budget proposals, big industrial policies and the launch of new funds, among others.  
* **Special policy investigation procedures outside trade defence:** Policy actions initiating sector-specific inquiries or reviews outside standard trade defence mechanisms where final determinations and resulting measures remain pending. 

### Missing affected jurisdiction 

This field is empty when there is no available information on the affected product or when the bilateral trade connected to the affected goods does not surpass USD 1 million with any trading partner. This field is also left empty when the policy intervention does not target any specific trading partner. 

### Missing distorted market

This field is empty when there is no available information on the affected product or when the bilateral trade connected to the affected goods does not surpass USD 1 million with any trading partner. This field is also left empty when the policy intervention does not target any specific trading partner.
