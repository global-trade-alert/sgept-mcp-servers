# Implementation Levels

This classification indicates the level of government or authority that implemented the intervention.

| implementation_level_id | implementation_level_name | implementation_level_name_long | implementation_level_description |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | Supranational | Supranational agency | Regional bodies with binding authority over member states, typically customs unions or economic communities. Examples: EU Commission regulations (binding on all 27 member states), Eurasian Economic Union common external tariff decisions, African Union trade directives, ASEAN coordinated trade measures. |
| 2 | National | National agency | Central government ministries, agencies, and central banks implementing measures at the national level. Examples: US Executive Orders imposing tariffs, Chinese State Council decisions on industrial subsidies, Bank of Japan monetary policy affecting capital flows, UK Department for Business issuing export licences, German Federal Ministry of Economics setting foreign investment screening rules. |
| 3 | Subnational | Subnational agency | State, provincial, cantonal, or municipal governments implementing measures within their jurisdiction. Examples: California emissions standards affecting imported vehicles, Bavaria industrial subsidies for regional firms, Ontario local content requirements in government procurement, Texas border security measures affecting trade flows, Quebec language requirements for imported goods. |
| 4 | SEZ | Special economic zone | Authorities administering special economic zones, free trade zones, or export processing zones with distinct trade rules. Examples: Shenzhen SEZ tax incentives for technology firms, Dubai free trade zone customs exemptions, Singapore Jurong industrial park benefits, Mexican maquiladora duty suspensions, Kenyan export processing zone VAT waivers. |
| 5 | IFI | International financial institution | Multilateral development banks and international financial bodies providing trade-related financing or imposing conditionalities. Examples: World Bank development policy loans with procurement conditions, European Investment Bank green bonds favouring EU suppliers, Asian Development Bank infrastructure funding with local content requirements, IMF structural adjustment programmes affecting trade regimes. |
| 6 | NFI | National financial institution | Government-affiliated financial institutions providing trade finance, export credits, or development funding. Examples: US Export-Import Bank subsidised loans for aircraft exports, German KfW development bank grants for renewable energy projects, China Development Bank infrastructure financing in Belt and Road countries, Japan Bank for International Cooperation tied aid. GTA records the NFI as implementer when a ministry announces a programme but the NFI administers or disburses the funds. |

## Usage Notes

- Most interventions (approximately 85%) are implemented at the national level (category 2)
- Supranational measures (category 1) are legally binding on member states and may be recorded both at supranational and national levels when transposed into domestic law
- Subnational measures (category 3) are particularly important in federal systems (US, Canada, Germany, Australia, India) where states/provinces have significant trade policy autonomy
- SEZ measures (category 4) often involve more liberal rules than the national baseline, but GTA records them when they discriminate between foreign sources or favour domestic firms
- Financial institution measures (categories 5-6) are recorded when lending or guarantees have trade-distorting effects (e.g., tied aid, export credits below market rates)

## Why This Matters

Implementation level affects:
- **Jurisdictional scope:** Supranational measures cover entire trading blocs; subnational measures affect only parts of a country
- **Legal enforceability:** National measures are typically more stable than subnational measures that may be challenged or overridden
- **WTO disciplines:** Subnational measures are covered by WTO rules but enforcement is more complex (central governments are responsible for subfederal compliance)
- **Retaliation targeting:** Trade partners may retaliate against national-level measures but not subnational measures in some cases

## Common Patterns

- **EU measures:** Often implemented at supranational level (category 1) but may also appear as national level (category 2) when member states implement EU directives
- **US measures:** Mix of national (federal executive orders, Commerce Department rules) and subnational (state procurement preferences, California regulations)
- **China measures:** Predominantly national (category 2), though SEZ measures (category 4) are common in coastal provinces and development banks (category 6) play major financing roles
- **Development finance:** Categories 5 and 6 often involve tied aid (recipient must purchase from donor country), which GTA records as discriminatory even if presented as development assistance
