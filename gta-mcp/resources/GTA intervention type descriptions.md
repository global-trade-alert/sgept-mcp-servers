## Export ban

### Description

The prohibition to export a good or service. 

Whilst unlikely, be aware that such an intervention may be related to a TBT or SPS concern. Be especially alert if it concerns restrictions or bans on products without a specific standard or technical fulfilment or that the restriction/ban is imposed on foodstuffs, chemicals, weapons and other goods harmful to human and animal safety, which pose security concerns or other non-trade related areas. See “Sanitary and phytosanitary measure” and “Technical barrier to trade” below for more information.

### Examples

[Malaysia: Introduced a temporary export ban on scrap iron in Sabah](http://www.globaltradealert.org/state-act/60335)

On 11 June 2021, the government of Sabah temporarily banned the export of scrap iron.

The objective was to ensure sufficient raw materials for the operations of the local steel industry.

The export ban would be lifted when a mechanism for imposing a state sales tax on scrap iron exports had been formulated.

The regulation entered into force on 11 June 2021 until further notice.

[Turkey: Turkish government introduces a licensing requirement on the export of sugar](http://www.globaltradealert.org/state-act/61644)

On 30 December 2021, the government of Turkey issued a communique (2021/10) introducing a licensing requirement on the export of sugar. Subject product is classified under the tariff heading 1701\.

The decision is taken through an amendment of the Communiqué (No. 2006/7) on goods that are subject to export licensing requirements. According to the communique, those who want to export the products listed in the Communique are required to apply for an export license from the Ministry of Trade. The export licensing procedure is not an automatic procedure and granting an export license is at the discretion of the Ministry of Trade.

## Export quota

### Description

A restriction that sets a physical limit on the quantity of a good that can be exported. *The limit can be on the value or the volume of the goods concerned.*

### Examples

C[olombia: Government established export quota for metal scraps and waste](http://www.globaltradealert.org/state-act/61067)

On 7 September 2021, the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism of Colombia adopted Decree 1051/2021 establishing temporary export quotas for foundry scraps of iron or steel, waste ingots of iron or steel, as well as waste and scraps of copper, aluminium, and lead. The objective of the measure is to ensure local access to these raw materials, given that scraps are the main input of the Colombian metal industry and have been facing rapidly increasing exports in recent years.

In particular, it established a quota of 80,000 tonnes divided as follows:

* 7204.10: 1,167 tonnes  
* 7204.21: 14,576 tonnes  
* 7204.29: 7,765 tonnes  
* 7204.30: 47,717 tonnes  
* 7204.49: 12,775 tonnes

Notably, the previous export quotas, established in August 2020, were not longer valid since February 2021 (see related state act).

The measure entered into force 15 days following its publication in the official gazette (22 September 2021\) and will apply for one year (until 21 September 2022).

## Export tariff quota

### Description

An export regime in which quantities inside a quota are typically charged at lower export tax rates, than those outside the regime. The prior new levels are recorded in the quota level. Contact your supervisor if the in-quota tariff changes and the quota does not.

*At the GTA we do not distinguish between WTO-bound tariff-rate quotas and non-WTO bound quotas.*

### Examples

[Argentina: Government approves export tariff quotas on leather](http://www.globaltradealert.org/state-act/42827)

On 6 December 2019, the Argentine Executive has issued Decree 847/2019 reducing the applicable export tax on leather for a quota of 2 million units. The new export tariff quota has a temporary character and applies until 31 December 2021\. 

The new legislation establishes that the original export tax that was inforced before the application of the additional 12% export tax introduced via Decree 793/2018 is to be subtracted from the currently applicable export tax up until 31 December 2019\. As a consequence, the effective export tax on leather has been decreased from values ranging between 17% and 22% to values ranging between 5% and 10% until 31 December 2020, and to 0% between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021 unless the total quota has been fulfilled before this date.

The list of affected products are classified under the following tariffs subheadings: 4101.20.00, 4101.50.20, 4101.50.30, 4101.90.10, 4101.90.20, 4101.90.30, 4102.10.00, 4102.21.00, 4102.29.00, 4103.90.00, 4104.11.11, 4104.11.13, 4104.11.14, 4104.11.21, 4104.11.23, 4104.11.24, 4104.19.10, 4104.19.30, 4104.19.40, 4104.41.10, 4104.41.30, 4104.49.10 and 4104.49.20.

Previously to this legislation, no export tariff quota was applied to the affected tariff lines.

Decree 847/2019 has entered into force on 10 December 2019\.

## Voluntary export-restraint arrangement

Description

Used when exporting countries voluntarily limit the quantity of goods exported to specific markets. These self-imposed restrictions are undertaken in order to avoid the imposition of trade restrictions by the importing countries. The goal is to maintain market share for domestic producers while avoiding escalating trade disputes. We report this from the exporter's perspective (outflow). 

This category encompasses quota arrangements (MAST Chapter E511) that set specific quantity limits on exports. Consultation mechanisms (E512) and administrative arrangements (E513) are not considered meaningful under the GTA.

## Export tax

### Description

A tax charged by an authority on the exportation of goods and services. This may be a tax calculated on a per-*unit basis or on* the value of the exported good/service. *The tax could be any internal duty imposed on exports as well \- there is no split like in imports i.e. import tariff and internal taxation on imports.*

### Examples

[Indonesia: Increased Export Tax on Palm Oil](http://www.globaltradealert.org/state-act/60336)

On 27 August 2021, Indonesia announced the increase of the export tax on palm oil from USD 93 per tonne to USD 166 per tonne. 

The increase was a response to the higher reference price of CPO in August 2021\. The September CPO was set at USD 1,185.26 per tonne, up from USD 1,048.62 a month earlier.

The new export tax entered into force on 1 September 2021\.

### Description

Any action that facilitates or restricts exports but cannot be classified in any other export intervention type. Examples could include amending documentation or procedural requirements that could be considered meaningful, permitting/restricting exports through certain ports, restricting who can/cannot export rather than restricting the good itself, export monitoring, etc. If the intervention has a financial value, it might be classifiable under export incentive/tax relief/subsidy etc.

### Examples

[India: Additional port added for the export of Sawn Timber](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/72774)

On 31 December 2018, the Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry through Notification NO. 47/2015-2020 added Krishnapatnam as an additional port to the list of ports from which exports of "Sawn timber" made out of imported wood logs are permitted. Krishnapatnam will be the 11th import from which such timber exports will be permitted.

## Foreign customer limit

### Description

A ban or a limit imposed on local companies to provide a specific service to foreigners. This is considered an outflow intervention.

This intervention targets [Mode 2](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/serv_e/cbt_course_e/c1s3p1_e.htm) of services trade: consumption abroad. It is an export restriction of sorts for service suppliers of the implementing jurisdiction. The main identifier is that no one (the service provider) or nothing (the service) from the implementing jurisdiction is crossing borders \- the only one crossing borders is the foreign client. Put differently, the service is being provided locally to a foreign client. If the service provider or the service itself is crossing borders, that would be classified under a different service Mode and would be a different intervention type.

### Examples

[Kuwait: Restrictions on hospital visits of foreigners](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/11527)

On 1 June 2013, the Kuwaiti Government started implementing a measure restricting hospital visits of foreigners. The Health Minister, Mohammad al-Haifi, decided not to allow foreigners in public hospitals in the mornings. He stated that, in order to avoid overcrowding, hospitals should concentrate only on Kuwait citizens during morning hours. The measure is for the moment implemented only at the hospital of Jahra on an experimental basis for six months. After this trial, the measure is expected to be extended to all other hospitals in Kuwait.

This measure affects not only foreign visitors to Kuwait but also foreign migrants in that country.

The website of the Ministry of Social Affairs has not been updated in the last 5 years, but major newspapers and embassies confirm the measure.

## Local supply requirement for exports

### Description

This intervention type is to be selected when a governmental action limits exports linking this restriction to the fulfilment of certain local supply requirements, i.e. 50% of produced wheat needs to be sold to the domestic market, or exports of fertilisers will be prohibited until local supply is ensured. 

### Examples

[Indonesia: Mandated domestic sale of the coal production](https://www.globaltradealert.org/state-act/60274)

On 4 August 2021, the government of Indonesia issued the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Decision No.139.K/HK.02/MEM.B/2021 to mandate all coal companies to domestically sell 25% of their coal production. As a consequence, the amount of product that can be exported has been limited.

The objective of the regulation was to fulfil the domestic demand for coal. 

The regulation entered into force on 4 August 2021\.

## Import tariff

### Description

A tax charged by the customs authority on the importation of goods and services into a country. The duty may be imposed on the quantity of goods (specific basis) or on the value of the goods imported (ad valorem basis). For example, 10% duty on the total value of goods imported or USD 10 duty per unit imported.

Under the WTO regime, the term MFN (Most-Favoured-Nation) tariff is also used. This is the normal non-discriminatory tariff charged on imports (excludes preferential tariffs under free trade agreements and other schemes or tariffs charged inside quotas).

### Examples

[Brazil: Reduction of import duties on certain vehicles](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/83718)

On 24 December 2020, the Executive Committee of the Brazilian Foreign Trade Chamber issued Resolution Nº 137 establishing a new import duty on vehicles specially designed for travelling on snow; special vehicles for transporting people on golf courses and similar vehicles. The affected good is classified under tariff subheading NCM 8703.10.00.

As a consequence of the change introduced the import tariff was reduced from 35% to 20%. The previously applicable tariff was adopted via Annex 1 of Resolution Nº 125 of December 2016\.

The new import duty applies as of 1 January 2021 and does not affect member states of MERCOSUR.

## Import price benchmark 

### Description

A price that serves as a benchmark or guiding price used by customs authorities to assess the accuracy and reliability of declared import values or to determine the duty base for specific goods. This intervention type encompasses both prices which trigger additional scrutiny or require justification when declared values deviate significantly, and prices which establish a fixed valuation floor below which duties are calculated using the threshold price. These mechanisms are implemented to prevent under-invoicing and shield domestic markets from unfairly priced imports.

### Examples

### MAST classification

MAST 2019 chapter F12 \- Reference prices

Chapter name \- Price-control measures, including additional taxes and charges

## Minimum import price 

Description

A minimum import price sets a threshold below which the importation of a product is prohibited. Unlike a benchmark price, this measure prevents exporters from selling goods to the implementing jurisdiction if the price falls below a specified level.

Please note: If the import restriction involves measures other than a complete ban, such as [requiring import licenses for goods priced below a certain level](https://globaltradealert.org/state-act/91412), we would classify the instrument accordingly. In such cases, the measure would be reported as an *import licensing requirement*, and the price threshold would be noted as the prior/new level.

## Import tariff quota

### Description

An import regime in which the duty is changed in relation to a quantity. Usually, this takes the form of an import tariff reduction that only applies to a concrete import quota. As a consequence, there are two different applicable import duties: one applies for importations within the quota, and the other applies for the rest of imports. 

For this intervention type, prior/new levels are recorded based on the information tight to the quota (i.e. we compare the previous quota with the new quota). Frequently, the comparison will be made based on the quota volume (i.e. prior level \= 1000 tonnes, new level \= 2000 tonnes), however, sometimes, the regulation changes the value of the in-quota duty (i.e. prior level 2%, new level 0%). Such changes in the in-quota duty will also be reported under this intervention type.

In (rarer) cases in which both the quota volume and the in-quota duty change, two import tariff quota interventions are to be reported (e.g. a green one for the increased quota volume and a red one for the increase in the in-quota tariff).

### Examples

[MERCOSUR: Approval of tariff-rate quotas on certain mixtures of odoriferous substances](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/83546)

On 17 December 2020, the Trade Commission of MERCOSUR has adopted Directive 78/20 allowing Argentina to establish a temporary 2% import duty on mixtures of odoriferous substances like the ones used in fabric softener and powder detergent classified under tariff subheading NCM 3302.90.90. The new duty applies to a quota of 1,250 tonnes.  

Previously to this legislation, no tariff rate quota applied to this product, however, in 2018 and 2019 a similar tariff-rate quota was approved for the affected product (please, see related state act). 

According to the WTO tariff download facility, the applicable average import tariff outside the quota is 14%.

Directive 78/20 only applies to Argentina for a period of 365 days.

### MAST classification

MAST 2019 chapter ID \- “Instrument unclassified”

## Internal taxation of imports

### Description

Refers to changes related to taxes on imports other than those classified as import tariffs. These would typically be higher internal taxes (e.g. VAT rates) on imported goods versus local goods. Note that sometimes a full import duty consists of the import tariff \+ other taxes (e.g. transportation levy, VAT etc). This instrument would be selected when the implemented change targets the "other taxes" related to imports.

Please note that if the VAT is lowered on a good (e.g. bananas) this is considered a green action as VAT impacts imports more than local goods \- see GTA example. 

### Examples

[Turkey: The government conditionally provides a duty exemption to the importation of sardines](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/99581)

On 28 October 2021, the Turkish government removed the Mass Housing Fund (MHF) surcharge on sardines (Sardina pilchardus, Sardinops spp.) provided that the imported product is used in the production of prepared or preserved fish. In the case of the importation of the sardines for other purposes, a 23% MHF surcharge will be applied. Sardines are classified under the HS code 0303.53

The decision is taken through a revision in the list of the products subject to discounted customs duties within the scope of the end-use legislation.

MHF surcharge is a type of internal tax applied to imported products.

[Portugal: Temporary VAT exception for acquisitions of products necessary to fight the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/86283)

On 7 May 2021, the Portuguese authorities adopted Law N° 13/2020 which grants a temporary exemption from Value-Added Tax (VAT) to the intra-community acquisitions of goods necessary to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, the standard VAT rate in Portugal is of 23%.

In particular, the Annex specifies the list of HS codes subject to the VAT exemption. The products need to comply with one of the following requisites, i.e. to be acquired by public entities or non-profit organisations, to be distributed freely, or to target the treatment of COVID-19 patients. 

The measure entered into force retrospectively, namely on 30 January 2021, and shall be applicable until 31 July 2020\.

## Other import charges

### Description

This intervention captures all additional import-related charges levied at the border (before customs clearance) beyond the standard MFN duty. These measures are used by governments to influence the domestic impact of imports through price stabilisation, seasonal protection, or revenue generation. 

Additional import charges beyond standard tariffs include three main MAST Chapters: 

* Variable Charges (MAST Chapter F3), which are duties that fluctuate in response to international price movements to stabilise domestic markets;  
* Customs Surcharges (MAST Chapter F4), which are fixed, ad hoc levies imposed on imports primarily for revenue generation or to fund specific costs such as port infrastructure, statistical services, or environmental protection; and  
* Seasonal Duties (MAST Chapter F5), which are temporary additional tariffs applied during specific times of the year—often aligned with domestic harvest seasons—to protect local producers from seasonal surges in imports.   
* Additional taxes and charges levied in connection with services provided by the Government (MAST Chapter F6), with no internal equivalent 

Please note that these additional border charges differ from the internal taxation of imports, which are domestic taxes applied after customs clearance.

On 31 October 2019, the South African Reserve Bank has issued Circular No. 18/2019 relaxing the restriction set on movements of capital in and out of the Common Monetary Area (CMA) which comprises South Africa, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland.

Concretely, the new legislation allows South African individuals to obtain up to 40% of the equity shares and/or voting rights in a foreign company that holds investments or makes loans to a CMA country.

Furthermore, investments in foreign funds or asset managers that invest in foreign companies with interests in a CMA country are also allowed.

Previously to this legislation, this was forbidden.

## Competitive devaluation

### Description

The GTA does not at present report capital controls due to issues over the taxonomy. This instrument is used when a country deliberately devalues its currency to make its product's prices more appealing to countries with stronger currencies. As a consequence, its exports increase as more countries outsource goods/services from the country with the devalued currency.

Related to monetary policy and though it has an impact in trade, it is usually very hard to prove that the objective is purely trade-related (we could only assume this if the government states it clearly), thus analysts should stay away from these actions (in general, it is non-GTA-reportable). If in doubt, contact the Ana Elena/Josse.

### Examples

[Nigeria: Devaluation of the Naira in November 2014](https://www.globaltradealert.org/state-act/9707)

On 25 November 2014, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) devalued the Naira by nearly 10 per cent and increased its interest rate from 12 to 13 per cent. The measure should counter the effect of falling oil prices as well as foreign investors selling Nigerian securities, i.e., shrinking foreign exchange accounts.

Several news sources reported the central bank governor saying: 'The depreciation at both the interbank and the BDC segments largely reflected recent demand pressures arising from the falling oil prices and dwindling external reserves. As part of the demand management measures, the Bank in two recent circulars excluded certain import items from the rDAS window. Despite the tight measures, the high demand for foreign exchange has continued unabated, This demand does not seem to have any bearing on the genuine foreign exchange needs of the country, which the Bank stands ready and has the capacity to meet. The current level of external reserves provides approximately 7 months of imports cover."

After the Presidential elections in February 2015, the CBN devalued the Naira again. Please, consult measure no. 9708 under Related Measures.

On 29 May 2019, the regional government of Victoria has adopted the 2019/20 Budget increasing the absentee land tax surcharge rate from 1.5% to 2%.

The new surcharge applies to individuals, corporations and trusts who hold any type of land in the Victorian region and that matches any of the followings:

* A foreign individual without permanent residency or that does not ordinarily reside in Australia;  
* A company not incorporated in Australia or where controlling interests rest in the hands of a foreign individual;  
* A trust with connections to an absentee individual.

The tax surcharge is calculated on the total taxable value of Victorian land owned by the foreign individual which is added to the individual's Victorian land tax assessment.

Surcharges do not apply if the total taxable value of the land is below the threshold of AUD 250,000 (approx. USD 173,000).

Based on recommendations from this body, the legislature subsequently enacted into law a new bill (SB 6551\) that the governor signed into law on April 2, 2020\. That bill made two amendments to existing law that are each intended to facilitate the licensure in Washington of international medical graduates (i.e., individuals who have graduated from a medical school outside the United States or Canada). One of those amendments provides that,

An applicant may obtain an exceptional qualification waiver, waiving requirements determined by the commission in rule, if they possess an acceptable body of work related to research, medical excellence, or employment, and have the recommendation of other national or international experts in the same specialty or field.

Another amendment provided that the Washington Medical Commission “may issue a time-limited clinical experience license to an applicant who does not qualify for licensure” under existing law provided that the applicant “meets the requirements established by the commission in rule for the purpose of gaining clinical experience at an approved facility or program.”

On 6 July 2020, the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) announced the increase of the Nigerian Content Intervention (NCI) Fund's budget from USD 200 million to USD 350 million. The increased funding will allow the NCI Fund to raise the use of local content in the oil and gas supply chains.

According to the NCI Fund, it promotes local content participation in the oil and gas sector by incentivizing the funding recipients to utilize local goods and services in their operations. 

Previously, the NCDMB expanded the budget of the Nigerian Content Intervention Fund from USD 100 million to USD 200 million in 2017 (see related state act).

Nigerian Content Intervention Fund

The Nigerian Content Intervention Fund was launched in 2017 by the Nigeria Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) and is managed by the Bank of Industry, a Nigerian development finance institution. The Fund was created to provide preferential funding to the companies operating in the Nigerian oil and gas sector in order to boost indigenous participation in the industry. Another objective of the Fund is to promote the use of Nigerian content in oil and gas production alongside related activities. Since April 2020, the interest rate charged on all the Nigerian Content Intervention Fund's loan products does not exceed 6 per cent.

On 16 June 2022, the government of Argentina published Resolution 438/2022 increasing the local content requirement on biodiesel included in automobile biofuels sold in the country from 5% to 7.5%. The measure enters into force one day following its publication. It was issued under Law 27.640 of August 2021 which set the regulatory framework for biofuels until 2030\.

Specifically, Article 4 of the law mandates that biofuels be "produced in Argentine factories and from national raw materials". The present Resolution increases the minimum volume percentage of locally-produced biodiesel used in biofuel blends. 

In this context, the Secretary of Energy, Darío Martínez, noted: "We are increasing by 50% the mandatory cut of the biofuels law for Biodiesel, taking it from the current 5% to 7.5%, putting non-exporting SME producers in a very important role that should derive in increasing the production volumes of national oil, boosting the production of the sector promoted by the law" (own translation).

## Local labour requirement

Description  
When an action requires the use of local workers. This could be done by forbidding the hiring of foreigners or by imposing a concrete localisation requirement (eg. In order to carry out a certain project, X% of workers participating in that project have to be nationals of the country where the project is been carried out)

On 15 October 2020, the National Cybersecurity Authority of Saudi Arabia through the "Cloud Cybersecurity Controls" imposed a requirement on cloud service providers to fill positions of cybersecurity functions in data centers with "qualified and suitable Saudi nationals."

Cloud service providers, covered under the controls, are entities providing cloud computing services to government organisations in Saudi Arabia inside or outside the kingdom, to companies and entities of the government organization, and to private sector organizations that own, operate or host critical national infrastructures (CNIs\*) that currently use or plan to use a cloud service.

Apart from this, the controls have also set requirements for local operations (see related intervention).

\*Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) are defined as assets "whose loss or vulnerability to security breaches may result in \- • Significant negative impact on the availability, integration or delivery of basic services, including services that could result in serious loss of property and/or lives and/or injuries, alongside observance of significant economic and/or social impacts. • Significant impact on national security and/or national defense and/or state economy or national capacities."

## Local operations incentive 

### Description

When incentives (i.e. forms of subsidies) are provided in return for a form of local operation guarantee. Notably, the local operations condition is not mandatory but voluntarily agreed upon by commerce. Examples of this include providing bailouts to companies in return for maintaining current local operations (i.e. not moving their business abroad) as well as subsidies directly granted for projects if operations are to a certain threshold located in the country. For cases where no incentives are issued, see local operation requirements.

### Examples

[United States of America: Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/113852/local-operations-incentive/united-states-of-america-inflation-reduction-act)

On 16 August 2022, the President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 which contains amongst other provisions certain fiscal incentives related to climate change and energy security. The IRA provided a USD 7,500 income tax credit to consumers for new EVs and USD 4,000 for previously owned EVs. Tax credits will become effective on 1 January 2023\. These tax credits are provided in return for a local operation guarantee. Specifically, these tax credits can be claimed as long as final assembly occurs in the US. Notably, the final assembly in another North American country is also treated as if it occurred in the US. 

Apart from energy and climate change provisions, the IRA also made a number of revisions to the corporate tax code, and includes healthcare provisions. The total value of incentives for energy and climate-related programs is roughly USD 369 billion and it includes a number of tax credits and funding to support the production of electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy technologies, and critical minerals (see related interventions).

On 15 October 2020, the National Cybersecurity Authority of Saudi Arabia issued the "Cloud Cybersecurity Controls" with the objective of strengthening national cybersecurity. With this objective in mind, certain minimum requirements on service providers and service receivers have been set. Specifically under section 2-3 on "Information System and Information Processing Facilities Protection", the controls require that cloud service providers provide cloud computing services from within Saudi Arabia. This includes systems used for storage, processing, disaster recovery centres and for monitoring and support.

Cloud service providers, covered by the controls, are entities providing cloud computing services to government organisations in Saudi Arabia inside or outside the kingdom, to companies and entities of the government organization, and to private sector organizations that own, operate or host critical national infrastructures (CNIs\*) that currently use or plan to use a cloud service.

Apart from this, the controls have also set a restriction on personnel engaged in cybersecurity functions in these entities (see related intervention).

\*Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) are defined as assets "whose loss or vulnerability to security breaches may result in \- • Significant negative impact on the availability, integration or delivery of basic services, including services that could result in serious loss of property and/or lives and/or injuries, alongside observance of significant economic and/or social impacts. • Significant impact on national security and/or national defense and/or state economy or national capacities."

## Local value-added incentive 

### Description

When incentives (i.e. forms of subsidies including export subsidies) are provided in return for a form of local value threshold guarantee. Notably, the local value condition is not mandatory but voluntarily agreed upon by commerce. For example, car manufacturers receive a subsidy in return for maintaining a local value of at least 50% calculated on the basis of local labour cost or locally-produced inputs.

IMPORTANT: This instrument is to be used carefully and only for those cases where the action cannot be classified clearly under a different instrument which would be more precise.

### Examples

On 14 October 2022, the Swiss Export Risk Insurance (SERV) announced its support of an export project by Swiss company Maschinenfabrik Rieter AG. This transaction is subject to localisation incentives.

More specifically, to be eligible for support, a transaction must involve goods of Swiss origin or with sufficient Swiss content. Goods are considered to be of Swiss origin “if they are made of domestic materials or are manufactured entirely in Switzerland, or were processed or finished in Switzerland to a sufficient extent.” Alternatively, transactions are eligible for support if the export contract value has a minimum Swiss content of 50%. In certain cases, SERV may decide to also cover transactions with less than 50% Swiss content "if the export transaction complies with SERV’s objectives."

Notably, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Council temporarily lowered the threshold of required Swiss content to 20%. This is applicable until 31 December 2022\.

When an action requires the incorporation of certain minimum percentage of local value-added. A frequent example is when the governeemtn imposes that al PV cells produced in the country must incorporate X% of additional value-added originating from the country.

### Examples

[United States of America: Department of Energy strengthens the domestic manufacturing requirements for inventions resulting from DOE funded R\&D programs](https://www.globaltradealert.org/state-act/60942)

On 8 June 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) introduced a new policy strengthening the domestic manufacturing requirements on R\&D funding recipients of DOE Science and Energy Programs. According to the new policy, inventions resulting from DOE-funded research and development shall be “substantially manufactured” in the United States. The policy includes federally-funded grants, cooperative agreements, and research and development (R\&D) contracts of DOE Science and Energy Programs. DOE will implement these actions through a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances under the Bayh-Dole Act.

The Bayh-Dole Act already required that “entities granted exclusive licenses for federally funded inventions to substantially manufacture them domestically unless they secure a waiver” through a “U.S. Preference clause”. However, DOE argues that this “U.S. Preference clause” has been “largely ineffective” as the funding recipients can “easily maneuver around” the requirements because it only applies to exclusive licenses for domestic sales or uses. Hence, DOE incorporated the “U.S. Competitiveness Provision” to the Bayh-Dole Act through Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) for new R\&D funding opportunities issued by DOE's applied energy offices and Office of Science. The provision stipulates that “any products embodying any subject invention or produced through the use of any subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States unless the contractor can show to the satisfaction of DOE that it is not commercially feasible.”

This new provision extends the domestic manufacturing requirement to non-exclusive licensees and to uses and sales beyond the domestic market. It also states that "if a contractor or other recipients of the invention rights undergo a change in ownership amounting to a controlling interest, then the rights are suspended unless DOE provides written approval. That restriction also applies to cases in which such entities sell, assign, or otherwise transfer title or exclusive rights in the invention.”

This policy change has been implemented as part of the efforts to strengthen domestic supply chains for critical technologies. Previously, for this purpose, in February 2021, the U.S. Administration issued Executive Order (E.O.) 14017 “America’s Supply Chains” directing DOE and some other government departments to assess vulnerabilities in, and strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains, through a report to be prepared within 100 days. Following this 100-Day review period, departments announced various policy actions. It is stated by DOE that this new policy change will cover more than $8 billion in clean energy and climate innovation funding requested in the President’s Budget for Fiscal Year 2022\.

Enacted in 1980, Bath-Dole Act, also known as Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act, regulates inventions that result from federally funded research.

# Public procurement policy

## Public procurement access

Description  
When a measure refers to a change in the conditions under which foreign companies can/cannot participate in a public local (*government)* tender. 

A good example would be the government limiting access to foreigners for tenders worth below X amount, or for tenders related to X industry.

Examples  
[Russian Federation: Certain Medicaments Allowed Access into the Russian Public Procurement System](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/81376)

Foreign medications necessary to treat leukemia and lymphoma will be given unhindered access to the Russian public medical procurement system, the Government decided on 3 August 2020\. 

Normally, medicaments included in the "List of vital and essential medicines" cannot be procured from abroad, if there are at least two offers from competing manufacturers in the Eurasian Economic Union. 

The government admits that in certain cases, such a limitation interferes with effective treatment, and changing the drug or using drugs from another manufacturer can worsen the patient's condition, especially in aggressive diseases requiring stable therapy.

The drugs that will not be subject to "third one out" access rule described above include filgrastim, caspofungin, micafungin, carboplatin, voriconazole, sevoflurane, rituximab, fludarabine. They are used in malignant neoplasms of lymphoid and hematopoietic tissues, as well as in the treatment of orphan diseases in children.

The original List and the "third one out" rule are formalized in the Government Resolution dated 30 November 2015 N1289 that the current Resolution amends. The modification that admits the pharmaceuticals above is in force between 7 September 2020 and 1 January 2022\.

The Russian government actively uses procurement policy to promote the localization of pharmaceuticals.

## Public procurement localisation

Description  
When a measure imposes local sourcing requirements (i.e. have to be obtained from local companies/manufacturers) on bidders of public tenders. This is often imposed as a percentage of the good (local value addition requirement) *or project* value.

### Examples

[Mexico: Local content for electricity infrastructure projects managed by CFE](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/86399)

On 1 June 2021, the Secretariat of Economy and the Federal Commission of Electricity (CFE in Spanish) of Mexico established the determined percentage of national content for the electricity Priority Investment Projects (PPI in Spanish) in charge of the CFE. PPIs are infrastructure (including energy) projects considered of vital importance for the Mexican economy. 

A minimum of 12% of local content will be asked for when assigning the PPI operators, whilst the desirable rate was set at 25%. Before the introduction of the measure, there was not a requirement for local or national content for electricity-related infrastructure projects. Notably, as the measure is not mandatory under the current Electricity Law, the minimum local content requirement will only apply for contractors of CFE-controlled projects.

The press release highlights that the measure will continue "to strengthen the national industry and generate a greater number of jobs" (own translation). In more detailed declarations to Forbes México, representatives of the two involved agencies declared that "it is estimated that PPIs generate a total of 30 365 jobs".

## Public procurement preference margin

### Description

This instrument is to be used when the measure provides a particular cost advantage to local bidders. For example, the tender might say that domestic bidders are granted a 10% preference margin, meaning that, if a local bidder offer USD 100 million and a foreign bidder offers 105 million, the local bidder will win the tender as his bid was increased by the value of the preference margin i.e. USD 110 million. There could be other examples such as domestic bidders getting a chance to match the lowest bid if the lowest bidder is a foreign company or financial support to local bidders to meet the foreign bidders.

### Examples

[Brazil: Preferential margins in public procurement of capital goods](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/20281/)

On 3 April 2014, the Brazilian government decided in Decree no. 8.224 to apply a margin of preference of up to 25% for the public procurement of capital goods. There is a margin of 15% or 20% if a good was produced, and a further 5% if it was developed, in Brazil.

This means that a domestic producer will be preferred by the government if the contractor offers a price that is within the range of the lowest bid by a foreign company plus the preferential margin. Brazil's preference margins scheme was introduced by Law no. 12.349/2010 as part of the Plano Brasil Maior, i.e., Greater Brazil Plan (see Related Measures).

The measure (Decree no. 8224\) came into power on 4 April 2014 and lasts until 31 December 2015\.

On 15 February 2021, the Saudi government announced ceasing to contract with any foreign firm or entity which has its regional headquarters outside of the kingdom.  The cessation will include agencies, institutions, and funds owned by the government and will take effect on 1 January 2024\.

In this context, according to the Saudi Press Agency (SPA): "The decision aims to incentivize the localization of businesses by foreign companies that deal with the kingdom’s government or any of its agencies, institutions, and funds. It also aims to create more job opportunities, limit economic leakage, increase spending efficiency and increase the guarantee that the main goods and services purchased locally produced to increase local content."

The new decision is part of Saudi's Vision 2030 that aims to transform the Saudi capital into one of the top 10 largest city economies in the world.

# Subsidies and state aid


## Equity stake
### Description
When the government acquires ownership shares in a company, becoming a shareholder. The state receives voting rights, profit participation, and bears downside risk. The company does not repay this capital—the government exits by selling its shares. This dilutes existing shareholders.

## Financial investment support
### Description
When the government supports an intermediary that subsequently makes investments in operating companies. The government does not act as a direct investor in end companies. The fund manager retains investment discretion within a defined mandate.

## Lending support
### Description
Government financial backing provided to intermediary financial institutions to facilitate corporate credit access. This includes government funding that enables intermediaries to originate new loans, government guarantees that support intermediary lending activities, and government support for intermediaries to issue their own loan guarantees to third-party creditors. In all cases, the intermediary rather than the government directly manages the creditor relationship.

## Debt purchase
### Description
When the government buys existing corporate bonds or debt securities, becoming a creditor after the debt was already originated. The government purchases debt instruments that were previously issued—either directly from the company (primary market) or from investors (secondary market). No new debt is created; the government simply replaces the previous creditor.


## Financial grant

### Description

Non-repayable funding. Remember to evaluate if this instrument type has an eligibility requirement or special mechanism which we would record in a different intervention type for example, if a financial grant is given per product produced we would classify this as a production subsidy, not a financial grant, if provided for the development of a local company abroad then financial assistance in a foreign market etc.

### Examples

[France: EUR 120 million aid scheme to sports clubs and events organizers (COVID-19)](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/83863)

On 12 December 2020, the French government published Decree 2020-1571 that establishes a EUR 120 million (approx. USD 145.3 million) scheme to provide financial grants to sports clubs, associations or event promoters in order to support them in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The measure was approved by the European Commission on 25 January 2021\.

The support will be granted via financial grants to partially offset the losses suffered by professionals in the sports sector relating to the sales of tickets, as well as the sales or distribution of food and drinks during an athletic event. Beneficiaries are sports companies that sponsored events during 10 July 2020 and 31 December 2020 and found themselves negatively affected by the limitations on public reception. In this sense, aid could be requested until 31 December 2020\.

In this context, the European Commission’s Decision highlights that “the measure is liable to distort competition, since it strengthens the competitive position of its beneficiaries” as well as it “also affects trade between Member States, since those beneficiaries are active in sectors in which intra-Union trade exists, thus attracting investors, athletes and consumers from other Member States”.

Regardless, the Commission approved the state aid without raising objections, concluding that the measure is compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article 107(3)(b) of the TFEU.

On September 11th, 2019, the regional authorities in China's southern Guangdong Province released its 'Catalogue of Encouraged Imports \- 2019 Edition' (hereafter, 'Catalogue'). The Catalogue lists goods which are classed as 'encouraged' imports.

The 2019 Catalogue added 72 items to the first section of the catalogue entitled 'Components'. The previous catalogue had been released in 2017\.

The new items included various specialised high-tech items including plasma spraying systems, wafer warpage testers and vacuum metal sputtering machines; please refer to taxonomy and original announcement for full details. Also, please note that the goods are classified under their Chinese classification, some therefore are lacking HS codes in the original document.

It is not immediately clear what exact benefits this catalogue provides to importers, however its format is very similar to the national-level 'Encouraged Technology Imports Catalogue' (see related act for an example thereof), which grants import discount interest to firms importing the relevant products.

Firms must be approved on an individual basis for the discounts.

The goods are those deemed 'essential for development' of the regional economy.

Guangdong is one of China's most financially prosperous regions, home to the mainland technology capital of Shenzhen.

## In-kind grant

### Description

A non-monetary asset subsidy (i.e. not cash-based). An example of an in-kind grant could be a government entity granting a company land or a building. An in-kind grant would also be if the government decided to build a road to a factory or extend a railway to the factory site i.e. providing infrastructure to the firm e.g. to promote an investment. 

Note that compensations linked to land expropriations are not GTA-reportable. Non-monetary assets may also be considered a production subsidy depending on the mechanism.

### Examples

[Luxembourg: Support for constructing multimodal platform in Bettembourg-Dudelange](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/90065)

On 16 June 2016, the European Commission approved an in-kind grant from Luxembourg valued at EUR 74.4 million (USD 83 million). The aid will support the state-owned CFL Terminals in the construction of the multi-modal (primarily auto and train) platform in Bettembourg-Dudelange. 

In particular, the non-monertary support consists of the establishment or construction of: site installation works, installation of a new compressed air station, foundations, buildings (excluding administrative building), platforms, railway superstructure, operating systems, security services, and outdoor facilities. 

In this context, the European Commission noted: "It can be concluded that the aid in question influences trade between Member States and leads to distortion of competition between EU undertakings which operate multimodal platforms" (own translation). 

Regardless, the Commission has decided not to raise objections to the aid on the grounds that the measure "is compatible with the internal market under Article 93 of the TFEU". 

The state aid is notified under the following objective: Environmental protection.

A state act in the GTA database is assessed solely in terms of the extent to which its implementation affects foreign commercial interests. On this metric, the financial support granted here is discriminatory.

## Interest payment subsidy

### Description

When the state pays-off part of the interest rate associated with a debt instrument (i.e. a loan or alike). This instrument only applies when the resources allocated by the government lowers the interest rate of loan(s) and not when the state provides loans with low-interest rates. NB\! If there is an intervention which is more precise than this type that intervention type should be used instead e.g. if the subsidy is a bailout.

### Examples

[Russian Federation: Further Interest Payment Subsidies to Companies of Systemic Importance](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/85591)

On 29 April 2021, the Russian government announced it will allocate another 3.9 billion rubles (USD 52 million) in a new tranche of interest payment subsidies for companies of systemic importance for the Russian economy. The subsidies aim at making loan interest around 2.6% per annum. To compare the basic rate set by the Bank of Russia in March 2021 is 4.5%. 

The qualifying loans should be of a maturity term of maximum one year and the signature date of 31 December 2021 the latest.

This new tranche is not part of a regular annual budget allocation \- it had to be requested and lobbied for by the companies, and is formalized in a dedicated government decree. Therefore, it is treated in the GTA as a new intervention, rather than a budgetary/temporal extension of an existing one. 

To provide some context, interest payment subsidies to backbone companies were announced as an anti-Coronavirus measure in April 2020, with some 230 billion rubles (USD 3.1 billion) worth of loans given out under the program in 2020\. 

The eligible companies, of "systemic importance to the national economy", are listed by the Ministry of Industry and Trade. To make it to the list, the company needs to be one of the following:

* major/sole employer of a municipality, with significant influence on regional economy  
* defense contractor or first-degree subcontractor  
* operator of critical infrastructure or defense services in Crimea, Sevastopol, Kaliningrad or Far East Federal District  
* a company active in the research and development of critical technologies or software  
* companies active in information security, programming and servicing government IT systems, Internet-based services of public significance (the later formulation is often used referring to the Russian search engine Yandex)  
* transportation companies serving distant domestic locations  
* dominant market players under the Russian competition law.

The list of companies published by the industry ministry spans 25 sectoral groups, ranging from the automotives to the furniture.

When a state guarantees a loan (i.e. assumes risk upon default) issued by a third party to a local entity. Coverage of insurance or similar trade guarantees would also be classified as a loan guarantee. NB\! If there is an intervention which is more precise than this type it should be used instead e.g. if the guarantee is linked to an export operation it would be trade finance. 

Note that it is important to understand who the end beneficiary of the guarantee is. In the cases where the beneficiary of the guarantee is a governmental institution, this would likely not pass RTT. Notably, loans guaranteed by another governmental entity would be considered double counting and should not be reported. 

Another important thing to keep in mind, is that when an announcement refers both to a state loan and a loan guarantee, we would only report the loan guarantee intervention if this is a different programme or different credible action (for a definition of what we understand as a credible action, see the document on duplication of interventions).  

### Examples

[Norway: USD 302.8 million loan guarantee to support Norwegian Air](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/100169)

On 23 March 2020, the Norwegian government approved a NOK 3 billion (USD 302.8 million) loan guarantee to support Norwegian Air in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. Norwegian Air is a national low-cost airline with operations primarily in Norway and the UK.

In particular, the guarantee can cover up to 90% of the loans Norwegian Air undertakes and can have a maximum of two years maturity. The implementing agency will be the Norwegian Export Credit Guarantee Agency (GIEK in Norwegian). 

In this context, the airline's press release states: "The Government guarantee scheme is crucial for the Company as the current state of the capital markets in combination with the challenging times for the airline industry limit the options available". 

The measure is implemented under the guarantee scheme for the aviation sector, approved days earlier (see related state act).

## Price stabilisation

### 

### Description

When the public sectors take actions to control/stabilise the prices of a concrete good or service by offering companies a minimum purchase price. Said companies may sell their goods at any other going rate. These actions are usually carried out by establishing fixed purchase prices as well as organising public purchase auctions or agreements. Note that price stabilisation actions are not limited just to these examples.

### Examples

[China: 2021 minimum purchase price of wheat increases](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/100396)

On October 29th, 2020, the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission released *Fagai Jiage* 2020/1647 (hereafter, 'Announcement'), which announced that the minimum purchase price of wheat was increasing for the following year. The Announcement stated that the price would go up by CNY 20 (USD 2.98), to CNY 2,260 (USD 336\) per tonne.

The price denotes the amount at which the government buys wheat from farmers at the minimum price when the market price drops below that level.

## Production subsidy

### Description

A production subsidy is direct financial support scaled on the basis of production activities. This can either be linked to funding per quantity produced or by providing monetary or non-monetary assets related to the subject goods’ inputs eg. by providing fertilizer.

### Examples

[Egypt: Ministry of Petroleum reduces the prices of of jet fuel to support the aviation and tourism sectors](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/83663)

On 13 January 2021, the Ministry of Petroleum announced the reduction of jet fuel gallon from EGP 0.20 (approx. USD 0.01) cents/gallon to EGP 0.15 (USD 0.01) cents/gallon for companies in the aviation sector. The new initiative aims to alleviate the repercussions of Covid-19 on the aviation and tourism sector.  The price reduction will take place from 21 January 2021 until the end of 2021\. 

According to the authorities, the reduction of jet fuel will help motivating international companies to increase the number of their trips to Egyptian tourist destinations, especially since aviation is one of the main activities that have a direct impact on the tourism sector and the reduction of fuel prices will reduce the price of flights' tickets. 

In this context, the Minister of Aviation Mohamed Manar Enaba said: "the petroleum sector is one of the pioneering sectors that continuously supports aviation movement through these initiatives, in addition to its important role in providing aviation fuel at all airports of the Republic, pointing out that there are full coordination and cooperation between the three sectors."

## Tax or social insurance relief

### Description

When the support comes in the form of a selective tax cut or rebate whether it is income tax, social security contributions, VAT, import tariffs etc. Remember to additionally report the reduced tax (e.g. import tariffs) if it impacts imports. E.g. Banana cake producers are granted 0% tariffs on banana imports. We would record one red tax relief with the HS code for banana cakes and one green sector-specific import tariff with the HS code for bananas. 

NB Clarification for what selective means \- the tax relief is available only to a particular producer/trader/entity/sector and not to everyone. If in the above example, the import duty was reduced to 0% on all banana imports, a tax or social insurance relief is not added.

### Examples

[Italy: Exemption from social contributions to reduce the labor costs of private employers (COVID-19)](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/100720)

On 14 July 2021, the European Commission approved a EUR 878.4 million (USD 10.3 billion) tax relief scheme from Italy. The aid will support all businesses from all sectors (with a few exceptions) irrespective of their sizes. The scheme is open to all sectors for all undertakings irrespective of their sizes, except for those operating in the financial, primary production of agricultural products and the domestic work sectors. The scheme is in force until 31 October 2021\.

The exempts private employers from their shares of social security contributions due to the Italian tax authority on the basis of new employment contracts. While the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies will be the authority responsible for the scheme, the National Institute for Social Security is the authority granting the aid. Aid shall not exceed EUR 1.8 million per undertaking.

In this context, the European Commission’s decision highlights that “The measure is liable to distort competition, since it strengthens the competitive position of its beneficiaries. It also affects trade between Member States, since those beneficiaries are active in sectors in which intra-Union trade exists."

Regardless, the Commission approved the state aid without raising objections, concluding that the measure “is compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.”.

The state aid is notified under the following objective: Remedy for a serious disturbance in the economy.

The state aid is approved under the Temporary Framework under the State Aid and its amendments. The European Commission adopted the Temporary Framework under the State Aid rules of the European Union on 19 March 2020 (see related state act)

[Austria: Government reduces VAT level for accommodation services from 13% to 10%](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/73021)

Example of lowered VAT (example of not being internal taxation of imports)

### On 1 November 2018, the Austrian government reduced the VAT applied on accommodation services including hotels, bed & breakfasts and camping. The VAT is reduced from 13% to 10%. Notably, the VAT on certain accommodation services of furnished rooms was increased to 13% from 10% on 13 May 2016\. The standard VAT level is 20% with reduced VAT rates of between 10% and 13% depending on the subject good or sector.

### The Austrian Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism noted in a press release that: "With the reduction in the tax rate, Austria is again approaching the same tax rates for accommodation in neighbouring countries and thereby ensuring Austrian hotel industry's international competitiveness. With the new tax rate, Austria is now at the same level as France and Italy." (own translation).

[Germany: Introduction of state aid to support promotional measures for the agriculture sector](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/88503)

On 28 July 2016, the European Commission approved a EUR 22.5 million (nearly USD 25 million) state aid scheme from Germany. The aid will support promotional measures for dairy producers. The scheme is in force from 28 July 2016 to 31 December 2020\.

More specifically, the aid will cover 100% of costs related to "publications, \[the\] dissemination of knowledge and information, advertising campaigns and advertising material." These payments will be made directly to the provider of the sales measures, rather than the producers. In this way, the German government hopes to promote agriculture sector development and foster increased support from consumers. 

In this context, the European Commission noted that when considering the conditions of Article 107(1) TFEU, the financial grant: "confers an economic advantage on its recipients and that advantage strengthens their position on the market." 

Regardless, the Commission has decided not to raise objections to the aid on the grounds that "it is compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article 107(3)(c) TFEU."

Notably, the total budget also reserved financial grants to small and medium enterprises in the form of direct reimbursements for "costs related to competitions, trade fairs, and exhibitions." However, given that the current budget is below USD 100 million, the reportable GTA threshold for SME measures, the financial grant was not reported.

The state aid is notified under the following objective: Aid for promotion measures in favour of agricultural products.

The aim of the supply chain financing initiative is to boost liquidity for local SMEs.

The first phase of the new initiative will target SMEs in the health sector. However, the initiative will be extended to SMEs in other sectors affected by COVID-19. 

In this context, the Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Department of Finance  Jassem Mohammed Bu Ataba AlZaabi said: " SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy and the key to long-term sustainable growth for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. As part of our forward-looking fiscal sustainability strategy, we are proactively launching this initiative in order to underpin continued liquidity for SMEs in Abu Dhabi.

# Export subsidies

## Export subsidy

### Description

An export subsidy is similar to a production subsidy, however, it is tied to exports rather than production. Such support can be anything from direct financial support scaled on the basis of export activities (e.g. the government grants dairy producers USD 2 per extra exported litre compared to the previous year) to indirect financial support (e.g. the government insures all export transactions made by dairy producers or covers all logistic costs). As such, this instrument is selected when the mechanisms directly incentivises increasing exports. Note that if the support takes the form of some kind of tax advantage (i.e. duty drawback, reduction of other kinds of taxes etc) then the correct intervention type would be tax-based export incentive. 

### Examples

[India: Subsidy for sugar mills for the season 2020-21](http://www.globaltradealert.org/state-act/46677)

On 16 December 2020, the Indian Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved a subsidy of INR 3500 crore (\~ USD 475.22 million) to assist the payment of dues to sugarcane farmers by the sugar mills. The subsidy intends to cover expenses related to marketing including handling, upgrading and other processing costs, costs of international and internal transport, and freight charges on the export of up to 60 lakh metric tonnes of sugar for the sugar season 2020-21. The amount will be paid directly to the farmers on behalf of the sugar mills against the cane price dues and any balance left over will be credited to the mills' accounts.

The Indian sugar season extends from 1 October to 30 September of the next year.

The official notification for this subsidy was published on 29 December 2020 by the Indian Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Administration. According to the notification, the assistance of INR 6000 (\~ USD 81.47) per Metric Tonne will be provided on exports of sugar. This amount is broken down as below \- 

* INR 1600 (\~USD 21.72) per MT for marketing expenses  
* INR 2400 (\~USD 32.59) per MT for internal transport and freight charges  
* INR 2000 (\~USD 27.16) per MT for ocean freight charges to foreign ports

An export subsidy of INR 10,488 per metric tonne was earlier announced for the sugar season 2019-20 (see related State Act).

On 20 May 2021, the Ministry notified a reduced rate of INR 4000 per MT on exports for contracts signed on or after 20 May 2021 (see related State Act).

The products and services will be used in the production and processing of oil and gas resources located in an offshore block in the Gulf of Mexico. In this transaction, Pan American Energy S.L. of Argentina will be acting as guarantor.

Concerning the approval of the loan, the US EXIM president said, “EXIM helps the world buy American, and yesterday’s Board action reflects EXIM’s support of American manufacturing jobs and objectives of the Program on China and Transformational Exports”. The transaction is estimated to support 200 jobs in Texas, Louisiana, and California.

In the same announcement, US EXIM also authorized a request from the Environmental Chemical Corporation (ECC) for a preliminary commitment of $120.8 million to support ECC’s contract for the Cameroon Southwest Region Water Supply Project.

### Examples

[EU: Approval of 2021 budget for the promotional programme for agricultural products](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/83648)

On 16 December 2020, the European Commission agreed on the 2021 Work Programme of the Regulation (EU) No 1144/2014 that funds promotional campaigns of European agri-food products within and outside EU markets. The Decision allocates EUR 88.1 million (approx. USD 107.5 million) to promotional campaigns implement outside the EU internal market, namely in third countries, during the year 2021\. This represents a decrease of EUR 30.3 million (approx. USD 37 million) from the 2020 budget (see related state act).

Specifically, the products eligible for the support are specified in Art. 5 of the Regulation (EU) No 1144/2014. They include HS chapters 01-13 (with some exceptions), 15-18, 20, 22-23 (with some exceptions), HS codes 45.01, 54.01 and 57.01, along with beer, chocolate, bread and pastry, pasta, salt, natural resins, mustard paste, sweetcorn and cotton.

The financial grants will be granted in response to two types of campaigns, known as “simple” and “multiple” programmes, with a main focus on the organic label. Simple programmes are submitted by businesses that all are from the same Member state. Multi programmes are submitted by businesses that can be based at least in two different Member states. Hence, these criteria determine the beneficiaries and identify them as businesses from EU Member states who need to fulfil further requirements outlined in the Work Programme.

The annual Work Programme also identifies priorities for third countries. Particularly, the encourage campaigns destined to China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Vietnam in Asia; Canada, the United States and Mexico in America; and the United Kingdom.

A state measure in the GTA database is assessed solely in terms of the extent to which its implementation affects discrimination against foreign commercial interests. In this metric, the aid proposed here is discriminatory.

On 23 August 2019, the International Trade Administration Commission of South Africa on behalf of SACU initiated an anti-circumvention investigation on imports of certain clear float glass from Egypt. This investigation follows suspicion that the definitive antidumping duty imposed certain clear float glass from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (see related intervention) might be circumvented. The products subject to investigation are classified under the following HS code subheading: 7005.29.17, 7005.29.23, 7005.29.25 and 7005.29.35. The investigation was initiated following the application lodged by PFG Building Glass (Pty) Ltd.

On 14 August 2020, the South African authorities extended the definitive antidumping duty imposed on imports of the subject good from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (see related intervention) to imports of certain clear float glass from Egypt. The rate of duty is 27.26%.

## Anti-Dumping

### Description

One analyst is covering all trade defence actions. Other analysts do not cover trade defence actions. Any mention of antidumping should indicate that this is beyond the analyst's reporting jurisdiction. If in doubt you can contact the analyst in charge of trade defence. Antidumping investigations and duties are initiated and imposed if a given government can prove that the imported good has been dumped. What does dumping mean? If a firm exports a good at a price lower than the price it would normally charge on its own home market, this is “dumping” the good. The WTO's Anti-dumping Agreement does not regulate companies which engage in such “dumping” activities, it focuses on how governments can (or cannot) react to dumping, i.e. antidumping investigation and duties.

### Examples

[EU: Definitive antidumping duty on imports of certain heavyweight thermal paper from the Republic of Korea](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/73584)

On 10 October 2019, the European Commission initiated an antidumping investigation on imports of certain heavyweight thermal paper from the Republic of Korea. The products subject to investigation are classified under HS code subheadings ex 4809.90.00, ex 4811.59.00 and ex 4811.90.00. This investigation follows the application lodged on 26 August 2019 by the European Thermal Paper Association.

## Anti-Subsidy

### Description

One analyst is covering all trade defence actions. Other analysts do not cover trade defence actions. Any mention of anti-subsidy or countervailing should alert the analyst that this might be beyond their reporting jurisdiction. If in doubt you can contact the analyst in charge of trade defence. According to the WTO: *Anti-subsidy actions are taken by the importing country, usually in the form of increased duties to offset subsidies given to producers or exporters in the exporting country*

### Examples

[EU: Definitive countervailing duty on imports of certain filament glass fibre products from Egypt](https://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/72181)

## Import monitoring

### Description

A regulation which in some way or form monitors imports *(without imposing any restrictions)*. The monitoring of the subject goods does not restrict the entrance of the goods in the local market and therefore such interventions are mostly amber 

### Examples

[EU: Introduction of import monitoring of certain aluminium products](https://www.globaltradealert.org/state-act/31379)

On 26 April 2018, the European Union issued Regulation (EU) 2018/640 introducing import monitoring of certain aluminium products of a value exceeding a net weight of 2,500 kg per tariff line. The goods subject to monitoring fall under the following HS codes: 7601, 7604, 7605, 7606, 7607, 7608, 7609 and 7616.99. The subject goods are first released into the EU upon the production of a surveillance document. The mechanism is in force from 12 May 2018 to 15 May 2020\.

## Safeguard

### Description

Also, known as Special Agricultural Safeguard (SSG) are (like trade defence safeguards) temporarily imposed as an additional duty on imports of goods. These goods are limited to agricultural products. The additional duty is imposed in response to import surges or price falls (as specified in the Agriculture Agreement). As noted by the WTO: *The safeguard may be invoked by a member only for those products that had been subject to tariffication and for which the right to use the SSG is inscribed in its schedule of commitments.* Special safeguards are notified to the Committee on Agriculture. Notifications can be found: [https://www.wto.org/english/tratop\_e/agric\_e/ag\_work\_e.htm](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/agric_e/ag_work_e.htm) with results listed here: [https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/FE\_Search/FE\_S\_S006.aspx?Query=@Symbol=%20g/ag/n/\*%20and%20(@Title=%20safeguard\*%20or%20@Title=%20sauvegarde\*%20or%20@Title=%20salvaguardia\*)\&Language=ENGLISH\&Context=FomerScriptedSearch\&languageUIChanged=true\#](https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/FE_Search/FE_S_S006.aspx?Query=@Symbol=%20g/ag/n/*%20and%20\(@Title=%20safeguard*%20or%20@Title=%20sauvegarde*%20or%20@Title=%20salvaguardia*\)&Language=ENGLISH&Context=FomerScriptedSearch&languageUIChanged=true#)

[Japan: Safeguard on importation of frozen beef](https://www.globaltradealert.org/state-act/36020)

On  August 1, 2017, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) ordered for a emergency safeguard on the imporation of frozen beef until March 31, 2018\. During the period that this safeguard is in effect the changes in import tariff rate will switch from (current) 38.5% → (after exercise) 50.0% . 

This special safeguard mesaure will be triggered when the amount of imports at the end of each month exceeds 117% of the import volume of the previous fiscal year. 

Nations which have signed EPA's with Japan will not be subject to the increased tariffs from this special safeguard measure, however their imports still are calculated into the import volume that can trigger the safeguard.

## Intellectual property protection

### Description

Currently changes in relation to Intellectual Property rights are not covered by the GTA. If you find any particular relevant case, please, contact JJ or AES

This instrument was added to the GTA database to cover restrictions imposed by governments in relation to intellectual property rights.

### Examples

[Australia: Changes to the Intellectual Property Law](https://www.globaltradealert.org/state-act/31777)

On 24 August 2018, the Parliament of Australia enacted the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Act 2018 approving new changes to the intellectual property law of the country.

One of the key changes introduced with the new legislation concerns the parallel importation of trademarked goods. Concretely, Section 122A establishes the conditions under which the parallel importation of trademarked goods does not infringe a registered trademark. In this sense, the new law sets out the following circumstances:

* the importation has the consent of the registered owner of the trademark or an authorised user of the trademark;  
* an importer is a person permitted to use the trademark by the registered owner;  
* an importer is a person permitted to use the trademark by an authorised user who has the power to give such permission;  
* the importation has the permission of a person with significant influence over the use of the trademark by the registered owner or an authorised user; or  
* an associated entity of the above.

These changes prevent registered trademark owners from parallel importation through the separation of ownership of its marks.

## Sanitary and phytosanitary measure

### Description

Measures concerning food safety as well as *to protect* animal and plant health. I.e. Sanitary: for human and animal health. Phytosanitary: for plants and plant products. The GTA does not cover SPS actions. Some actions may claim SPS reason without being an SPS. In such cases you should, 1\. check if the action has been notified as an SPS or TBT measure at https://epingalert.org/ 2\. Formulate an argument why this seems not to be an SPS action 3\. Contact a reviewer to discuss if it should be reported.

*(measures aimed at protecting the environment, consumer interests or for animal welfare are not covered by sanitary and phytosanitary measures.)*

## Technical barrier to trade

### Description

Technical Barriers to Trade are defined under the WTO TBT Agreement. The GTA does not cover TBT actions. Some actions may claim TBT reasons without being a TBT. Read the below and evaluate if this is the case.

Under the agreement, TBT actions concern technical regulations or conformity assessment procedures.

Technical regulations impose certain mandatory standards on products as well as their related processes and production methods. Such measures are among others introduced due to human, animal or plant life or health, for the protection of the environment or to meet other consumer interests. This could be anything from imposing requirements related to size, weight, packaging, labelling, marketing or composition. E.g. in Japan, a kettle must have a specific safety mechanism if it falls over on its side.

Conformity assessment procedures relate to checking these imposed technical regulations or standards. This can include the authorities testing and sampling the products, the inspection and evaluation of the goods as well as the approval processes among others.

For this purpose, technical regulations shall not be more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective, taking account of the risks non-fulfilment would create. Such legitimate objectives are, inter alia: national security requirements; the prevention of deceptive practices; protection of human health or safety, animal or plant life or health, or the environment.

If you believe that the TBT claimed action is not a TBT you should or is a TBT and… (see below example) you should do the following, 1\. check if the action has been notified as an SPS or TBT measure at https://epingalert.org/ 2\. Formulate an argument why this seems not to be an SPS action 3\. Contact a reviewer to discuss if it should be reported.

### Examples

The below example provides an exemption to reporting TBT requirements. Whilst one would consider a labelling requirement within the scope of a TBT it goes beyond this by descriminating and promoting local produce to a degree we would consider relevant to cover.

## Trade balancing measure

### Description

When an action imposes restrictions related to the importation of the products used in the production of a good linking this restriction to the number of local products that can be exported, or when limitations are set in relation to access to foreign exchange used for the importation of such goods.

For example, when a regulation states that companies can only import materials and products used in the manufacturing up to X% of its exports earnings from previous years.

Important: These are very rare actions where the key objective of this measure is to keep a balance between the amount of exported and imported goods (usually imposed in relation to currency issues)

*(Re-written: A restriction with the objective of keeping a balance between imports and exports, mainly to avoid foreign exchange issues. The restrictions attempt to mainly limit imports for eg. by restricting the amount of imports allowed based on exports performance, an obligation to fulfill export obligations on importers, an obligation to purchase locally on importers, etc.*

*It could also be a restriction on the access to foreign exchange available for importation of products based on the foreign exchange inflows generated by the enterprise.)*

### Examples

[Macedonia: Temporary restrictions on the imports of wheat and wheat flour](https://www.globaltradealert.org/index.php?mod=Measures_Module&p=,4,5127&l_r=1642497696)
